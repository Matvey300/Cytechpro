Impressive sound and comfort at a great price!

I’ve been using the JBL Tune 510BT Bluetooth headphones for a few weeks now, and I’m genuinely
impressed. The sound quality is excellent—clear highs, solid mids, and surprisingly strong bass for
headphones in this price range. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio is
crisp and consistent.
The Bluetooth connection is reliable and pairs quickly with my devices. I’ve had no issues with
dropouts or lag. The battery life is another major plus. I easily get through several days of casual use
on a single charge, and the quick-charge feature is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry.
Comfort-wise, the headphones are lightweight with cushioned ear pads that don’t cause fatigue
during longer listening sessions. The controls are simple and intuitive, and the foldable design makes
them easy to store and carry.
For the price, these headphones deliver fantastic value. I’d gladly recommend the JBL Tune 510BT to
anyone looking for quality wireless headphones without breaking the bank.

Great headphones with good quality sound and battery life

The JBL Tune 510BT headphones truly deliver on all fronts! From the moment I paired them with my
phone, I was impressed by how quick and effortless the Bluetooth connection was — no lag, no fuss.
Whether I’m switching between my Android phone and tablet or hopping on a call, the connection
stays stable and smooth every time.
The sound quality is where these really shine. Crisp highs, deep bass, and a well-balanced midrange

make everything from podcasts to playlists sound amazing. JBL’s Pure Bass feature adds just the right
punch without being overwhelming.
Battery life is another huge win. I’ve been using these daily for work, workouts, and travel, and I easily
get close to 40 hours on a full charge. Plus, the fast charging is a game-changer — just a few minutes
of charge gives me hours of playback.
They’re also lightweight and fold up nicely for travel or commuting, with a comfortable fit that doesn’t
pinch or feel heavy after long use.
Overall, these are an excellent value for the price — perfect for anyone who wants premium sound,
reliable Bluetooth, and marathon battery life without breaking the bank. Highly recommended!

These work so good, they connect very fast and the battery life is so long! These are easy to fold up

Headphones are decent
Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2025
Color: Black Style: headphones Verified Purchase
They have a good enough build quality and feel to them. The sound is fine but could be better. Battery
lasts a long time. Mic works great for calls. Only downside is they don't fit too comfortably on my head
but for the price it's good value for your money.

Good Quality BT Headphones
Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2025
Color: Rose Style: headphones Verified Purchase
These are great headphones for the price. They connect to BT devices easily, and the earpieces are a
comforting size. The sound quality is decent; you get what you pay for there. Mic quality seems to be
good. I don't have trouble with conference calls. My only complaint is they do weigh on the peak of my
head and that gets uncomfortable. Otherwise I love them they are great.

These headphones did not disappoint! The sound is crisp, deep, and powerful—perfect for music,
podcasts, or even calls. The bass hits just right without overpowering everything else.
They’re super comfortable to wear, even for long periods, and the battery life is impressive. I love how
easy they are to connect, and the design feels sleek and durable.
Great quality for the price—JBL never misses when it comes to sound.

JBL 510BT Bluetooth Headphones

If you're looking for a reliable, budget-friendly pair of Bluetooth headphones, the JBL 510BT is a solid
choice that delivers great value for the price.
Comfort & Fit
The fit is surprisingly good, snug without being tight, and lightweight enough for long listening
sessions. The ear cushions are soft, and the adjustable headband helps create a comfortable fit for
different head sizes. Whether you're using them at the gym, on a walk, or during a workday, they stay
put and feel comfortable.
One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. JBL claims up to 40 hours, and it really
delivers — you can go several days without needing a recharge.
Pairing is quick and easy. The Bluetooth connection is stable, with no dropouts or lag. It connects
seamlessly to both iOS and Android devices, remembers your device for auto-pairing after the first use,
just turn them on and you're ready to go. For the price, the sound is very solid.
Pros:
Comfortable, secure fit
Long battery life (up to 40 hours)
Fast charging
Easy Bluetooth connection
Lightweight and foldable
Great sound for the price
Cons:
No noise cancellation (but not expected at this price)
Mostly plastic build (still feels sturdy)
Overall
The JBL 510BT is an excellent choice for anyone who wants reliable wireless headphones without
breaking the bank. Whether you’re commuting, working out, or just enjoying music at home, these
headphones get the job done. I highly recommend for casual listeners looking for comfort, battery life,
and value.

JBL delivers.
Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2025
Color: Blue Style: headphones Verified Purchase
This is my third headphone that I’ve been using since January. I’ve gotta say that JBL did not
disappoint. This was a prime day purchase for $27 and it was well worth it.
Pros
Sound is amazing. Deep bass which I come to expect from JBL and crisp high ends.
Price is amazing too.
They had a variety of colors to choose from. I selected the blue and am happy with the the look.
Cons
Only con I can mention is the fit, it felt a bit snug on my head and it definitely is the least comfortable
of all my headphones.
Overall I 100% recommend this for the sound but if you’re gonna do a marathon workout session it
won’t be the most comfortable.

🔊 Pure Bass Audio & Balanced Clarity
JBL’s signature Pure Bass delivers deep, punchy lows without drowning out the mids and highs. Music
from pop to EDM comes to life with power yet remains clean and detailed—perfect for both intense
tracks and relaxed listening .
🎧 Lightweight & Foldable Comfort
These headphones are compact, sleek, and super easy to carry—ideal for commutes or travel . The
adjustable headband and breathable ear cushions feel comfortable enough for marathon listening
sessions (though a bit snug if you wear glasses after a few hours) .
⏱ Incredible Battery Life & Fast Charging
With up to 40 hours of playback and a quick 5-minute charge giving 2 hours of listening time, I’ve
gone weeks without needing to recharge—an absolute game-changer .
📱 Multipoint Pairing & Easy Controls
Seamlessly switch between phone and laptop with Bluetooth multipoint pairing—and use the intuitive
buttons on the ear cup for volume, track control, calls, or activating voice assistants .
📞 Clear Voice Calls
The built-in mic performs great during calls—others report hearing me clearly even in noisy places . It’s
perfect for work calls, casual chats, and podcasting alike.
Minor Considerations
Noise isolation is moderate—don’t expect ANC-level blocking, especially for low-end rumble . Build
quality is solid entry-level; treat them with some care around the hinges . And if you wear glasses or
have larger ears, you might feel the ear cups a bit after extended wear .
Why It’s a 5‐Star Pick 🎉
Pure JBL bass with crisp clarity
Long-lasting battery with fast charge feature
Comfortable, foldable design perfect for travel
Easy multipoint pairing + reliable mic
Excellent value

Incredible Sound, Noise Canceling & Battery Life!
Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025
Color: Rose Style: headphones Verified Purchase
These headphones have completely exceeded my expectations! The noise cancellation is outstanding ,
it blocks out background sounds even in busy places like cafés or public transport. I can finally enjoy
music and podcasts without distractions.
The volume is impressively loud and clear, with deep bass and crisp highs. Whether I'm listening to
relaxing music or working out, the sound quality stays top notch.
What I love the most is the battery life. I’ve been using them daily and only need to charge them once
every few days , they easily last over 30 hours on a single charge. Plus, the fast-charging feature is a
lifesaver when I’m in a hurry.
They're also super comfortable and don’t cause ear fatigue, even after long use.
