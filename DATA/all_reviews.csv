B07J2Z5DBM,TDodge,the United States,2025-07-31,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsInconsistency is annoying,"Really happy with these Tozo T10 Bluetooth earbuds, so much so that these are my 3rd and 4th set, respectively.  That said, I am unhappy that Tozo changed the design on these by moving the part that inserts into your ear from the center of the earbud to the front, more similar to their model A10 headphones, but kept the model number the same despite the change!  They also changed the size of the charging case.  So now I have 2 pairs each of 2 different style headphones with the same model number.  Bad form for any manufacturer.  Renaming the new design with it's own model number should have been obvious and straighforward.",True,0
B07J2Z5DBM,Jimmy,the United States,2025-07-31,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing for a long time till now,I have had this for a while now (I think I have a older version than this that they changed) and never had a issue extremely long charge while using and stand by (I stopped using them for eight-ten months and they still had charge) but lately the sound just randomly cut. It doesn’t pause or lowers the sound to zero just stops. This is the first issue I’ve had but generally love these always reliable just hope for some help.,True,0
B07J2Z5DBM,Amazon Customer,the United States,2025-07-31,2.0,"2.0 out of 5 starsGood, but need a lot of work….","I’ve owned these for a year… the quality of the sound is decent. No major complaints. They’re cheap but they don’t sound bad. The biggest problem is connectivity/pairing. Every single time I take them out of the case to use them, they refuse to pair to my iPhone and my iPhone requires me to forget the device and re-pair them. It’s a massive pain, so much so that I’m just going to invest in AirPods now. The battery life is really good. I only charge the case once a week with everyday use. They’re not very comfortable, to me, but it’s easy to get over that part.",False,0

I thought there was some wax buildup so I cleaned them but same issue. But then the volume would randomly go back to normal so it was just the earbuds themselves.

Straight out of the box these are head and feet shoulders better. Better sound, they actually stay in your ear, lighter and more comfortable, comes with different foam pieces, and it’s a quarter of the price. I had my buds about 9 months before I started having issues so if I can match or exceed that for $100 less I’ll be a happy camper.",True,0

B07J2Z5DBM,C. Richardson,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent Keychain Earbuds!,"I've had these earbuds for over two years now, and they're still going strong. Before this, I owned a much more expensive pair of Apple earbuds, but I actually prefer these. They sound just as good, fit more securely in my ears, and offer one feature I absolutely love: a built-in loop that lets me attach them to my keychain—no extra case needed. I often find myself wanting earbuds on the fly, and having them always on my keychain is incredibly convenient. I wish more earbuds came with a simple built-in keychain loop like these do. With most other brands, you have to buy an extra accessory for that, and it's never as sleek or practical as this built-in design.",False,0

The sound quality is great, bass hits and highs are clean and crisp. I haven't had any issues with them aside from the magnet falling out of the lid. They still work most of the time but I am having connection issues with one bud. A few taps and it works again. For the price you can't beat them. I blast them loud ASF at work and for the most part no one else can hear them and they block out noise good enough. I would buy them again but am going to try a newer model from tozo. Overall great buy, cheap enough to lose and not feel bad. I have had complaints about taking calls, they pick up background noises and echo. For music which is my priority they're great.",True,2

These earbuds are truly impressive, offering extraordinary sound and bass quality that exceeded my expectations. I used them daily and was consistently impressed by their performance and comfort. Unfortunately, after around a year, I experienced an issue with the original pair where the left earbud began to glitch and eventually stopped producing sound. When I reached out to TOZO’s customer support, I was fortunate to be assisted by Winona, who provided phenomenal service. They responded promptly and professionally, guiding me through a few troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. When those didn’t work, they immediately offered to send me a replacement pair at no cost. I received the replacement earbuds quickly, and I must say, they sound just as incredible as the first time I tried them. I genuinely felt like I was experiencing the product anew. TOZO’s commitment to product quality and customer satisfaction is truly commendable, and I couldn’t be more pleased. Highly recommended, for both the product and the service behind it.",False,1

The IPX8 waterproofing was perfect for workouts and rainy days, and the wireless charging case added extra convenience. It lasted us about 3 solid years before showing signs of wear.

My last pair was my favorite but my mom like them so much, I had to give them to her. I thought it would be a quick and easy fix of ordering an exact same pair but NOPE. Whatever ""updates"" this version has, have been annoying. The headphones will randomly connect to the phone while in the middle of a phone call even though BOTH headphones have been placed in their case previously in the day and certainly before the phone call. The previous pair would easily disconnect as soon as they would be placed in the case, allowing a smooth and easy transition between Bluetooth devices or just phone volume alone. The previous version, would also have a verbal message for items such as when the headphones would be connected and then synced.

B07J2Z5DBM,MG,the United States,2025-07-11,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsTremendous bang for the buck. Great sound quality.,"I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile, and in my opinion, the TOZO 10 earbuds sound better than Apple's ear pods. (Disclosure: I listen to music through the Equalizer app available through the App store.) Bass sounds pretty good, treble isn't too tinny, they fit reasonably well, and overall, the sound reproduction is pretty awesome in its clarity. The one downside is that their bulkiness makes them uncomfortable to sleep with if you're a side sleeper, so I'm trying to find a lower profile pair for sleeping. But seriously, for $20, the sound quality on these is spectacular, and when I'm using earbuds anytime other than for sleeping, these are my choice.",True,1

B07J2Z5DBM,Bridgette77,the United States,2025-07-10,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsWow! These are amazing, and I am picky!","OK, I will start off by saying, I am not necessarily an audio file, but I know how I want my music to sound, and I like them to have plenty of base, and decent volume! I also need a good pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears, Since I do workouts! Now, let me tell you! These are amazing, and I couldn’t ask for better earbuds! I have a pair of Sony WXM fives over the ear, headphones, They were very disappointing! I have tried many other pairs of headphones from Sony‘s, Bose, JBL, J lab, soundcore, and a whole bunch others. While some of them are good, they are lacking in something. This is what was frustrating me. They either didn’t have enough base, volume, or they sounded muddy, or squashed. Some of the apps that came with some of them also did not work very well. I have a whole drawer full of headphones that were just not quite right for me. Then I decided on a whim to try these, and I wasn’t disappointed! These have amazing base, but they are also well balanced, and the base does not distort or drowned out the instruments or voices at all! Plus, you have a plethora of EQ presets to choose from, or you can adjust your own! You can also choose from others that other people have created inside the app. That is what I’ve done. I found a perfect equalizer setting that is perfect for my needs! Plenty of base, crisp and clear vocals, instruments are Perfectly spaced out where they should be, and you can even hear the high hats, without them being buried or too sharp.  The app is very easy to use as well. I am visually impaired, and I have no trouble navigating it. The only trouble I had was the profile set up, but that’s it. Once I got past it, everything was simple. And finally oh finally! I found a pair of earbuds that stay in my ears even on a run. Even when I am doing. Heavy resistance training, they still stay in. Even when I am upside down they stay in. They don’t come out. They come with a few sizes of eartips, so you should find ones that will keep them in your ears and block noise. They’re also good at blocking noise. Start with the largest tips and work your way down.  I’m actually using one extra large size in one ear, and one large size in the other. I have two different ear shapes. That’s what I did. The fact that these are also waterproof is great for me! I sweat a lot when I do workouts, so this is awesome. I’ve never been brave enough like others in the reviews have done, to take them in the shower yet. Maybe I’ll try it once I get my second pair today. Also, one more thing, the touch controls are very easy to navigate. I have not had any misses yet. They’re also very clear on calls as well from what I’ve been told. So these are perfect! I am very glad I bought two of them! I am very happy with these, and you won’t regret the purchase! Just do it! The price is right, why not? Get a couple pairs!",True,13
B07J2Z5DBM,AJ,the United States,2025-07-10,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsDecent for the Price,"Bought these to replace headphones that got destroyed in the washer. If they're in your ears the waterproofing is fine but I took a headphone out of one ear, it got water in the part that goes in your ear and it went out. After it had plenty of time to dry it was okay but shouldn't have done that to begin with. Other IPX8 headphones I've worn swimming with no issue but these need to remain unsubmerged. Sound quality is good, the connections a little spotty here and there when I first turn them on but not too bad and it improved quickly. They're decent headphones for the price. My main issue is the touch features are way too sensitive, my hair brushing across pauses my music and when I put on a hat it cranked the volume up. Water hitting either headphone also sets off the touch features.",True,1

The T6 earbuds fits comfortably in the ear and no fear of it falling out during the exercising activities.

The charging case does have an LED power indicator, but it doesn't tell you how much battery power is left in the earbuds.

Worked great, sat in the ear well, no issues connecting. Eventually they just got worn out from a lot of use, so I bought a new pair. Decided to get the blue because, ya know, why not? Y’all, these ain’t it. For starters, they won’t connect half the time when I take them out of the case. I have to constantly put them back in, take them back out, repeat for usually at least a minute to finally get them to turn on and connect. Also, these have a strange twist/curve shape to them that the old pair didn’t have. If it’s supposed to make them fit better in the ear, it wildly missed the mark. These constantly try to fall out of my ears; never had that issue with the old ones. And if I don’t position them juuust right, I actually get no sound out of them at all. The sound quality is good, at least. And the blue is pretty. But ergonomics and connection wise, these fall short.",True,0

Pairing is typical today and you get good Bluetooth range. I primary use them to listen to TV and the sound range covers all the bases. They fit fine and quality of workmanship is good. The only issue I have is the magnets that hold the ear buds against the charging pins in their case.

However, the pair I received most recently is a different model. They are all ""T6"" according to the product listing, but these are a different shape and the charging case is a different size. The old T6s were interchangeable between left and right, as the part that goes into your ear was straight. The new version is angled, so that they are no longer interchangeable. I wear one while I fall asleep and switch it from ear to ear when I roll over. So it matters that each bud fits in both ears comfortably. Also, the new charger case does not fit in my old protective silicone case, as the new version has different dimensions. Disappointed, I liked the old ones better, and can’t use my existing silicone case.",True,2

It took me some time to do even as it appears that I followed pairing instructions. Aside from the pairing issue, these earbuds are a gem! Like OMG they're terrific. For one, they just slide in (more like glide in) to your ears. The fit is perfect in every way. It gives a very strong seal. The fit, I couldn't ask for better. They fit better than some $1000 earbuds I've tried! Yeah seriously... If you want very good sound at a very very reasonable price, these are your buds. They're lightweight too.

B0F53L8J78,E. Gilder,the United States,2025-07-18,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsSolid value priced ear buds! Consider these,"Really solid earbuds!  TOZO T6 earbuds are for those seeking affordable waterproof wireless earbuds with good sound quality and a comfortable fit. They include multiple ear tip options for everyone’s ear size. Great for casual use, workouts, biking and commuting. Battery life is strong….around 6-8 hours of playtime per charge, with the charging case offering multiple additional charges for extended listening. This is important if you're taking public transportation, going for long walks or need to listen to something at night. Sound quality is fine however I think bass response could be better. The IPX8 Waterproof Rating allows the earbuds to withstand sweat, rain, and submersion in water. This makes them perfect for workouts and outdoor activities. Call quality is average. Good in quiet environments but the microphone struggles in noisy conditions. Unfortunately there is no Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). With only a couple of shortcomings, these are currently my favorite value priced ear buds yet!",True,7

They’re lightweight, comfortable, and most importantly, they stay put. I don’t have to keep adjusting them mid-workout, which is a huge win. The IPX8 waterproof rating is no joke either—I've even worn them in the shower post-run, and they still perform like new. Sound-wise, they hit a sweet spot. The bass has that nice thump when it matters, and the clarity across highs and mids is solid, especially after tweaking the EQ in the TOZO app. They’re not the most powerful in raw volume, but the soundstage is balanced and immersive. For the price? These are a steal. Battery life is reliable, and I appreciate the LED indicator on the case, even if the lid feels a bit light. The passive noise cancellation is surprisingly efective, once the music kicks in, background distractions fade fast. All in all, they’re a killer combo of performance, comfort, and value. Highly recommend for anyone with an active lifestyle.",True,0

Jaja but God saved me when I found these ones, they cancel all the noise 😭 I could not believe it but it is true, also the quality sound is good, these have some good bass configuration. Something I would like to enfatize is about the charging life, I usually charge the case only once per week or when I remember😂 cause the case battery last a lotttttt, and well after all of that I got one for my sister and another pair for my cousin as a gift cause I could not help and keep them only to myself.

The design is sleek and stylish — the soft pink color adds a nice personal touch without being too flashy. They're compact and comfortable, especially with the small size option that fits my ears perfectly. The sound quality is outstanding for the price. The bass is rich, vocals are clear, and the immersive sound experience makes listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls a real pleasure. The dual mic setup ensures my voice comes through clearly on calls, even in noisy environments. Battery life is solid, and the charging case is lightweight yet durable. The pairing process was seamless, and the customization through the app with 32 EQ presets is a great bonus for audiophiles. Another plus — they’re waterproof (IPX5), which gives me peace of mind during workouts or unexpected rain. Overall, a fantastic product that offers premium features at a budget-friendly price.

These were made for ""small"" ears. Even their larger earbud covers were to small and I heard to much street noise and Bass was very low. I held them in with my hands and the bass was there. I happen to have the same ear bud covers and I put the large ones on and bam, the bass was back with a pleasant overall tone and sound.  Problem was I couldn't charge them due to the increase size. They were not meant for it. I talked with Tozo and they had me try their hybrid Crystal Pods and that is the correct size for my ears and the sound for the money is amazing with enough satisfying bass. These are a great value for the money with very good sound. It's not their fault my ears are too large. Many people need smaller earbuds for their smaller ear canals.

B09FT58QQP,cd,the United States,2025-07-24,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsDecent,"This is my 2nd purchase of the Tozo A1 ear buds. My review of this recent purchase is compared from my older pair. Packaging: Current: Lightweight, efficient, decent protection, plastic tray Previous packaging was better, better quality, looked professionally packed Packing contents: Limited/Missing rubber cap sizes. There were way more sizes in my previous purchase Product review: 1. No real way to tell how much charge is left in battaries with a single LED on case. Previous case had 4 small LED lights which gave you an idea how much charge is left. 2. Fit is as good as previous, I was lucky given the limited amount of rubber cap sizes that came with the package. 3. Sound quality is good but seems softer than previous purchase, compared side by side. Clarity is negligible with less color with the new purchase. Perhaps that is a good thing. 4. A little difficult to get ear buds out of charging case, but understandable if size matters. 5. Auto power off does not seem to work. Ear buds were left out of the case for 10 min, they were still powered on. 6. Music functionality works, seems to work while streaming videos too on smart TV. 7. Call control and Voice assistant seems to work fine 8. There is a phone app that has a function to update firmware for the earbuds according to the manual. I wish there was a computer desktop app instead. 9. Manual does not indicate any functionality on muting voice calls. This is unfortunate. Summary: All in all, the ear buds are decent for the price. Yes I would buy them again in the future.",True,2

B08HMWZBXC,Jason Ashley,the United States,2025-07-27,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsGood quality -- some problems with calls,"I got these headphones around a year ago, and I have been enjoying them! The sound quality is great, and they're well made -- there's very little physical wear, to the point they're still close to how I got them, despite certainly getting their use. It's also very comfortable, and the noise canceling certainly does it's job. I do like how it has a transparent mode, even if I don't use it as often. The main problem I've had with them is the microphone. I've been told by multiple people how subpar the audio can be for calls, and occasionally I'd be in a call and the other person's audio will just suddenly degrade to that ""robot"" sound. The only thing that'd fix it when that happens is a complete power off and back on of the headphones. But it has happened multiple times on a single call more than once, which prevents me from giving it the full 5 stars. Other than that, though, this is a headset that I've been very happy with!

The headphones adjust to different head sizes so anyone from kids to big headed adults can wear them. They are durable as my kids are a little rough and their headphones are holding up well.

I recently bought a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4s to compare, and I couldn’t hear a noticeable difference in sound quality — definitely not a ~$300 difference.

In fact, it’s much better than the $300 Sony wireless Bluetooth headphones that I have. Unfortunately, I was listening to them while I was in bed and woke up with the headband broken right near the swivel point of the ear piece. I ended up having to duct tape it together. And I didn’t have this headphones very long. It’s sad really Because I really like the sound of the headphones. I read other reviews. There were people that had the same problem. This is very surprising because Anker makes good quality electronics and I own lots of different Anker products. The only reason I gave it three out of five is because of the sound quality. Otherwise, I would’ve given it one star. *** update ***  July 30, 2025 It turns out Anker reached out to me about my issue—I hadn’t even contacted them first. They must’ve seen my review and responded. To my surprise, they offered to either replace the headphones or issue a full refund. I chose the refund because I was concerned the same issue might happen again. I’m giving them four stars due to their excellent customer service. However, I still feel the headband design is inadequate (flimsy). For the record, Anker never asked me to change or update my review, which I truly appreciated.

Comfortable on the ears - wore for 5 hours the days I got them and didn't have any major discomfort 2. Sound quality - hard to beat for the price 3. Download the app - you can choose a variety of settings based on your preference whether you like R&B, Rock, or even podcasts. If you know how to use an equalizer, you can customize your own settings. The app is very clean as well. 4. Easy setup 5. Durable with a nice weight to them 6. Great for wearing while working (if your job requires longer periods of isolated work), doing chores, yard work, easy workouts (don't recommend high intensity, may not stay on) 7. Long battery life with super fast charging ability CONS 1. I purchased the black headset and only got a bag to store them in. Ordered my wife the navy color and she got a hard case.

I had JBL headphones and those last me years but had other issues but they were insanely durable, I got these headphones because they had better noise cancellation (which is true). At first they would fall off my head but after 2-3 days they fitted perfectly and stopped falling off entirely. I used to workout with them and no matter the exercise they would stay on snug, running, weightlifting, just fine. No technical issues ever, but turning the headphones off takes forever and most times doesn't work for me so I'd just disconnect them from my device and then turn off on its own so it was easier that way. The app they have is nice but it keeps logging me out so I barely used it. Disappointed with the Soubdcore company though because they make it so hard to get these headphones sent back in and I just did it through the warranty I bought with the headphones, instead of letting me send it for repair they sent me money and I just wanted them repaired so now I have to figure out what to even buy now or just buy these again which pisses me off.",True,1

Pros: sound quality was excellent! Which is why I bought to begin with. Cons: not a massive deal breaker, but the battery life was mediocre. I’ve had better. The cushion on the headphones fell off immediately and won’t stay on the originally when purchased. For the price point and JBL I’d expect better. The headphones seemed pretty cheap too. I did not have them long at all to enjoy any other features. HIGHLY disappointed with these headphones. The reason I purchased was because my headphones of 20 years the battery life lasted FOREVER and I do mean FOREVER!! The cushion fell off and the muffs were flaking off.

I use them for mowing for hours and these give me quality sound that cuts through the noise of the mower.

B0BTYCRJSS,Michael Madden,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat product at great price with important caveats,"5/5 for being a good product at a phenomenal price. I had Apple AirPods Pro that I got back in 2020, and they finally bit the dust early this year. In anticipation of potential AirPods Pro Max 2 release this upcoming fall, I did not want to shell out a lot of money on new AirPods, so I bought these. These do have their quirks (below). Honestly, though, these are such a good product that I may hold off on buying the new AirPods release until the buying public have beta tested the new release, and new release pricing has attenuated. Great price: I paid around $20, which is current discounted pricing from what I'm seeing Very good battery life: I've sometimes gone weeks without charging these, but usually during light usage; more often I'm charging them every handful of days. They also charge very fast, like less than an hour to get to full charge on the earbuds and case. Easy to pair: Self-explanatory. Does not automatically connect audio/microphone on inbound call (outbound call is automatically connected): When I'm listening to music and I answer an inbound call, these will not automatically connect audio and microphone--I need to go to the audio/microphone button on the phone screen to get the call onto that. It's not major, but it is an annoyance to answer a call and be like, ""One second [clicks button]...can you hear me now?"" When I have these connected and I make an outbound call, there is no interruption of connection. (Maybe I'm not changing some setting in iPhone, but I've not been able to find the culprit) Slightly odd shape, may fall out of ears easily: I have weirdly shaped ears, and any wireless earbuds often fall out of my ears. However, these really fall out of my left ear with simple things like talking on the phone. Case is very cheaply made: The case feels so light and plastic. Yes, I know that AirPods cases are also plastic, but this should have been made to be smaller and more solid, it feels flimsy. I really doubt that making this a little better would destroy the seller's profit margin, but maybe it would have. I also do not like the little strap that they provide, which one could use to attach to the outside of a bag or some such. I feel like the case might open if it were hanging off a bag and got knocked against something. I removed the little strap and only put the case inside my bag or pocket. No noise cancellation: As I said, these are a bridge to get me through to the new AirPods release and I would not expect noise cancellation at such a good price point. The Amazon AI summary said people rave about the noise cancellation, idk who is saying that, it's not true.",True,1

B0863TXGM3,Jake S.,the United States,2025-07-25,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsSony Headphones are the bomb thank you sony.,"So far, these are the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. I used to have Airpods, and those were a bit of a pain because of the fit in my ears. They always fell out and were uncomfortable. I eventually replaced them with the insanely bass boosted skullcandys. Those were fine, and I was pretty happy. Then my gaming headphones, the HyperX cloluds started to peel. I didn't want to get gaming headphones because I already have a microphone and don't want it to look gamey. I heard these headphones have a feature where you can connect to 2 devices and switch between them. So I bought them for my computer. Now, I can play games, and when I need to drop the kids off at the super bowl, I can do so without removing the headphones from my head, and can watch TIkToks comfortably on my phone. The audio swaps over no problemo. The audio quality is great, the ambient sound mode can be used to hear more than my hearing can hear, and when i want people to stop talking, the noise cancelling works well enough to prompt me to say yes to non-questions. The battery has lasted a while without needing a charge, and it is USB when it does need a charge. They are lightweight and sit well on my big head. The buttons are kind of funky, as most of the controls are with gestures that sometimes don't want to play well. I will say the app is terrible, the software is funky, and the features where it detects if you want ambient sound just doesn't work well. If you want $500 quality headphones but don't want to spend that much money, I believe this is the best choice. And for me they work as a two in one, so it really is like a $250 pair, but twice.",True,2
B0863TXGM3,Dee C,the United States,2025-07-25,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsBest Headphone Decision!,"I am not a self-proclaimed audiophile, so my review is for simple folk like me. I was torn between the Apple AirPods Max and the Sony XM4, and I am so happy I went with the XM4 instead! These headphones are pretty lightweight which allows me to wear the headphones for hours without it feeling heavy on my head. They are also the perfect size for over-the-ear, so there is no discomfort of the headphones pressing against my head that on-ear headphones have. The noise-cancelling on these is excellent, I can work from home in peace or do work in public without disturbances. Battery life is also great and you won't have to charge these super often. Audio quality is the best I've had in an audio device. It's crisp and clear, my music sounds amazing and I get to experience it in a high-quality way I haven't before. Sounds significantly better than my Beats Solo 3. Also a HUGE upgrade and spectacular from regular AirPods. There is a Sony Connect app you can download to further customize your headphones (e.g. fine tune equalizers, fine tune the noise cancelling), but these also work straight out the box if you prefer to not download the app. The headphones have a power button and a ""custom"" button with some helpful shortcuts; you can press the custom button to turn on/off noise cancelling and turn on/off adaptive ambient noise. You can also press the power button to hear how much battery the headphones have left. I have an iPhone, iPad and Windows laptop- this doesn't clash at all with my Apple ecosystem and was also easy to pair to my Windows laptop! Overall, definetely my favorite choice I've made for headphones.",True,1

And the touch feature is a bit too sensitive, especially when I’m in the gym and my arms go over my head and lightly touch the headphones.

The first time it happened (less than a year after getting it) I thought it was just that pair. I ended up getting a second pair and lo and behold- another year later it broke in the same exact spot. I took it to get fixed which was quite expensive and hey- again, a year later (today) it broke again in the SAME spot.

B0863TXGM3,Artless,the United States,2025-07-22,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsVery pleasantly surprised! Great for focusing on work w/o completely shutting out your surroundings.,"I never used noise cancelling headphones before, but I work from home, and the outside noise this summer is too distracting. I was going nuts! These are perfect for me to focus while working at my desk. I put on a light, nature ambiance video from YouTube and the world is blocked out enough for me to focus. They also work great without any audio - just noise blocking. I can still hear a very light noise from the fan or my dogs which is what I prefer; I don't want to be completely shut off from my surroundings - just not driven to distraction. Phone calls come through fine from my mobile - clear sound. I should have bought these long ago for my own peace & sanity. I haven't read the instructions to figure out the touch controls on the headset yet, but I have accidentally bumped it and shut off the volume. Better read up on that function. So far I've controlled everything from my mobile phone. They are comfortable on my ears and don't interfere with my blue-blocker glasses or earrings. They also don't snag my long hair. The only concern is the longevity of the pad around the ear. It is a very soft & light material. It feels great so I hope it lasts. I'll just be careful with it. Color:  I ordered the midnight blue. Well - they are almost black. I cannot tell they are not black. In fact when they arrived, I forgot that I ordered blue until the next day when the sunlight caught the hard case and showed a bit lighter shade. So if you really like blue, these may disappoint. It's not a deal-breaker for me. I just get tired of everything being black and wanted some color. But they look black anyway.  :/ Case:  a big plus! I wasn't really considering the case when I purchased these since they'll rarely leave my desk. But if I were still doing a lot of air travel, I would be very grateful for this hard case. Zipper works smooth; there's a little loop on the outside to hang/clip the case and a mesh pocket. The inside is compartmentalized efficiently with the cord also. Great packaging, Sony! I've only used these cordless, so I can't comment on the included cord. Charging: the headset has a plug for apple chargers and another for regular C chargers. I have android and was stumped for few seconds when I couldn't connect my charging cord. (oops)  Just another reminder for me why I do not buy anything apple. These are excellent in my opinion. Pricey, but they should last me a long time and will help me get my work done without all of the distractions. I bought these on a July prime deal for $193. I would never have tried them at regular price, but I have to say they are worth the value if you have that budget. Highly recommended!",True,0

Good if you have small ears.,"Great sound, Sony always has strong bass, so if you like that trap sht or metal, you’ll bump in these. But, reviews RAVE about the noise cancelling, and for me, it was really bad - I think for two reasons: 1) I’m used to these https://amzn.to/3IEqeah (Bose 700) - they are amazing in terms of noise cancelling. 2) the earmuffs don’t cover the ears (my big*ss ears At least) so there isn’t a seal. It’s a press, which isn’t good and it leads to pain after about a half hour. So pros, I like the look, they are also super light which is sweet, and the bass is INSANE if you crank it in the settings. Cons: if you have big ears and really value noise canceling, get the bose 700",True,0

I saw a great comparison video of these against the more recent XM6s from Rtings and they stacked up pretty well. There was also a flash discount on the price so I jumped on them. However, the noise cancelling microphones that live in the ear cups rub against my ears. Rtings say the same thing: “However, they are shallower in profile than the Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Wireless, which can present discomfort if you have larger ears, as your ears may rub against the driver housing.” I just can’t wear them for any length of time without pain. ANC is pretty awesome. The build quality is nice, and the companion app was pretty decent. If I had smaller ears, I would be totally enjoying these.",True,0

Let me tell you, they are fantastic! At first, the price tag seemed a bit steep, but after using them for about a year, they have become indispensable in my daily life. The battery life is remarkably long-lasting, allowing me to enjoy hours of uninterrupted listening. The Bluetooth setup was effortless, making the initial connection a breeze. They fit snugly and comfortably, providing a secure hold, yet they are surprisingly durable and can withstand daily wear and tear. However, I have noticed that wearing them for extended periods can sometimes lead to a touch of nausea, which is unfortunate. Additionally, they have a quirky tendency to automatically revert to noise-canceling mode, regardless of the settings I choose.

B0863TXGM3,Candace,the United States,2025-07-10,3.0,"3.0 out of 5 starsNice, But Not Worth the Price","I use my headphones during the day for work and when doing chores around the house. I own a pair of Beats and a pair of Sony WH-CH250s ($75), which I got for $30 on sale. Ultimately, the XM4's are nice, but they lack key functionality. The Good: These are light weight without feeling cheap. They come with a nice case that includes a space for all of the accessories. They came partially charged, so you can use them right out of the box. They do not hurt my small ears, and I can wear them all day if I need to with no pain, and very little ear sweating. The sound is what I would expect from Sony, and the noise cancelling feature is nice. It does connect seamlessly with the Sony Connect app. The Acceptable: Due to the noise cancelling, these headphones have middling battery life. It says 30 hours, but they stated low battery after two days of use. The less expensive CH250s can go much longer without that warning. They also have a feature that automatically turns off when removed from the head and auto-off when set down. Sometimes I would like to leave them on and connected, but I can see why this feature is desirable for most. The Bad: I, even with my small hands and fingers, cannot turn up or down the volume without pausing or ending a call.  The CH250s have physical buttons, but these do not. I cannot for the life of me understand how upgrading a device results in a worse user experience. The feature to change songs suffers from the same issue. It is pretty awful design. I know that sleekness is valued, but functionality should not be secondary to ease of use. The other issue is the playback. I ordered these headphones because one of the issues with the CH250s is that you often have to go to the app to switch playback to devices, even overnight. This problem is particularly annoying when the headphones are paired with a phone. They frequently switch back to the phone, even when using another device. I hoped the upgrade would fix this problem, but it remained. After two days, I am returning these headphones because the lack of physical buttons for volume is beyond annoying and makes them borderline unusable for me. The frequent use of the app to fix the playback to the device remains a minor but annoying problem. I got them on sale for $184, and they are not worth it, and they are certainly not worth $300 when not on sale. I ordered the Bose QuietComfort for $10 more; they have buttons!",True,2

The Beats CONSTANTLY stop playing music and the ONLY solution is to unpair and repair. I've tried quitting the apps (both a music player and youtube) and reloading, won't play. I've tried rebooting my phone and it won't play. The only solution is a total reset of the bluetooth pairing to get it to play again. Calling apple's support is (as always) a nightmare, and I know the hell they give their agents because I have family member that works for them and they got in trouble for taking time off to go pick up their brother's kid because the brother got arrested (single dad). So crappy product from a crappy brand. The battery life is pointless when it's a daily battle to get music to KEEP PLAYING (I know, revolutionary thing to want in ear buds).

They are comfortable, easy to use and provide decent sound. I use them mostly to listen to audio books and podcasts. The first pair I purchased lasted about three years. Then I pushed the power button a little too hard because it would start and I damaged it. Since that was my fault, I decided to give them another try. I was super careful with the power button and the volume button to not damage them. This pair refused to charge after 14 months. I contacted Apple support via text and the agent was super nice, patient and tried to find a solution for me. Unfortunately, no solution worked. It was offered that I could send the product in to Apple and they would fix what seemed to be a hardware issue for $70.10.  I found that to be unacceptable, as I could purchase a new pair for only $45.00. I asked for a free repair or a free replacement pair. My request was denied.

There is no indication of the battery life, including in my phone, nor is there a y indication that its about to die, they just die. The battery is so small, you need to charge them quite often.

They are awkward to turn on.  I didn't use them much, and after 4 months, they quit working -- won't power on.  Apple support for Beat products is very difficult to contact online.  The phone support person was very polite, but had difficulty in looking up the serial number.  (Yes, there is a serial number printed in very tiny print on every set.)  He offered to let me take the earbuds to their closest store for service . . . but they had no appointments available.  So, I would have been going 50 miles away to the second closest store.

B08H1WNYTR,Lucas K Prater,the United States,2025-05-27,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsGood for 11 months. Then batteries stopped charging.,"I bought these July 22, 2024. It is now May 27, 2025 and the Right-side earbud has stopped charging so it dies almost immediately when I use them now. I used these for lifting weights so I only wear them in the gym 3 days a week for a couple hours at a time. I leave them in my car the rest of the time. Leaving them out in the car, in the cold could have lessened the battery life but I have no proof of that—just speculating. These earbuds were pretty good for the money. I listen to audiobooks/podcasts in the gym so I never had any complaints about the sound quality. The bluetooth also works really well. It always connects immediately. My only complaint is that the right earbud's battery seems to be kaput, so I'll need to try another pair. I probably won't buy these again due to the relatively short lifespan of the batteries (less than a year). For the money, these cheap-o, offbrand, chinese earbuds worked fine. I paid $27.27 so basically $30 for pretty good bluetooth, wireless, handsfree sound in the gym. They worked well under sweaty conditions. But again, for less than 1 full year. My only complaint is that the batteries seem to be low quality. I probably should have brought them inside at night so they weren't exposed to the cold, but then I'd be sacrificing the convenience of never having to remember my earbuds when I go to the gym. If I had to do that, inevitably I'd forget them and then I'd be pissed that I'd have to use old-school wired earbuds. So I guess for $30 I got good bluetooth and the convenience of always having them in the car—for 11 months. Decent trade I guess.",True,3

Your sound is literally going into the charging port. If you turn it off at your phone, it turns itself back on intermittently while it’s charging. Not sure who the bonehead is who decided they should charge while on and trying to connect to a Bluetooth device but it’s obviously the dumbest thing in the history of Bluetooth devices and it doesn’t matter how many times you turn it off, it just turns itself back on. Your only option is literally disabling Bluetooth features on your phone or computer until it’s fully charged so you can turn it off and with a range of 20-30 feet, there is very few places you can charge it that it won’t try to hijack your Bluetooth device.  It also loses the ear coverings on a semi regular basis so make sure you buy the four dollar set of spares on Amazon.",True,3

B08H1WNYTR,Amazon Customer,the United States,2025-03-14,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsEverything I'm looking for, good value","Overview – Long lasting, good sound, good mic, wireless charging, everything I’m looking for and no downside. Background – I wear earbuds almost all day, whether I’m listening to audio books, podcasts, or calling into work meetings. I wanted something that clipped over-the-ear instead of just sticking in place because I sometimes wear them while mountain biking, and I’m worried they’ll fall out and get lost/broken. I wanted wireless charging and a long battery life. Pros – Always works. I’ve had this product a few years now (on a 2nd pair) and never needed to replace it due to a functionality issue. (I lost one ear bud when I dropped the case. Thus the “2nd pair”). Feels comfortable enough to wear all day Battery lasts 6-8 hours of constant use. Case recharges them very quickly. Case charger uses USB C and can also be charged wirelessly. I love this combo because in the past the charger port is usually the failure point on my devices, and USB C or wireless seem to be the best solution. Sound is good. I can’t say I’m an expert on sound quality for music, etc. But for meetings and speech, I have no issues. Others can also hear me clearly when I talk, which has been an issue with other devices. Cons – It’s a small con, but I wish the case snapped shut or was held together slightly better. Everytime the case drops to the floor, you can just count on the earbuds popping out. I don’t think these are overpriced, but there are much lower cost options if those meet your needs. Final Thoughts – These are my go-to ear buds if I ever need to replace, them I’ll re-order the same product.",True,4

B09FLNSYDZ,Meredith,the United States,2025-07-19,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsReview of two sets of earbuds from this brand.,"In the past I had bought both the light blue and the lavender earbuds. The case is quite bulky and if you’re wearing jeans or anything with small pockets, they’ll likely fall out easily. The blue earbuds lasted from May-ish of 2024 - September of 2024. The left earbud stopped working after falling out of my pocket one last time. The right earbud still works, but the left is useless. The purple ones I replaced in March of 2025 after I noticed the right earbud was a bit quieter than the left and there was an underlying buzzing in the audio. I work at a pool and so there’s a lot of moisture, especially when I put them in after getting in the water. It hasn’t detrimentally deteriorated the audio. The purple right earbud even fell into the water and seemed to still be working fine after. I’m a fan of the over ear grips and the silver buttons that sticks out rather than being a button blended into the surface like many other brands. It’s nice to be able to skip a song by lifting my shoulder to double click the button. I don’t think the microphone was that good though. Overall, they’re a decent brand for the price, but I’d recommend only if you don’t mind that they may not last a very long time. Don’t use the headphone decibel thing if you’re on apple. It will adjust the sound to be that exact decibel constantly rather than preventing you from raising the volume higher than that level.",False,0

The sound is super punchy, especially the bass — perfect for hip-hop, R&B, or anything with a beat. They really bring music to life if you like your audio bold. The battery life is crazy good. I can go days without charging, and when I do need to, that Fast Fuel feature actually works — I can get hours of use from just a few minutes of charging. They’re also really sleek and clean-looking. I love the way they fold up, and they feel pretty durable. Pairing with my phone was super easy — instant with Apple, a little slower with Android but still smooth. Now the only downside: they’re tight on the ears. After a while, especially if I’m wearing glasses or earrings, I start feeling the pressure. I wish they were a little more comfortable for longer listening sessions. Still, if you’re into style, bass-heavy music, and need something that won’t die on you mid-day — these are a solid pick. Not for hardcore audiophiles, but perfect for everyday use.",True,1

They stay in place while running but can get a bit sweaty, so I usually wipe them off after. I can’t wear earrings with them, which is pretty normal for over-ear styles.

B085296FLT,Rock N Roll!!!,the United States,2025-06-18,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsThe Microphone Sucks!,I have used the head phones for about a month now. I wanted to give them a fair chance before leaving a review.  Two most important features of the headphones to me someone who is considered an Audiophile. 1:sound quality 2: The Microphone. 1:Sound quality. Sound quality in these headphones are acceptable.  At first I thought they were horrible. I had previously owned a pair of JBL’s. The sound quality JBL’s were slightly better.  For some reason with the beats I had to really play w the EQ once connected in order to tweak the sound to what i enjoy.  There was a huge muffled sound w the music I generally listen to (Rock/Metal).  Even after playing w the EQ and getting a better sound I can still hear a Muffled quality sadly.  2:The Microphone. It just plainly SUCKS!  I usually talk to my Wife while at at work but ever since I have had these headphones the conversations are short due to her being unable to understand me.  I usually have to almost yell in order for her to hear me. Which I don’t like to do when others are around me.  I shouldn’t have to raise my voice so others can hear my conversation around me.  The other thing I have noticed is although while listening to music the Noise canceling.  The minute you get a phone call or make a phone call the Noise canceling stops and you can now hear everything outside the headphones. Which at times can make it difficult to hear the person on the phone w you. What I do like about the head phones is they do cover the ears and are very comfortable to wear. They do not/have not fallen off my head when i bend over to do something.  They also look nice.  But for amount paid for them not really worth the money.  I wish I had waited and bought a pair of Bose but I was desperate for a new pair of headphones considering my old ones were over 5yrs old and weren’t doing it for me any longer.  I hate long reviews but this had to be said.  If you are not big into music and sound quality and Mic are no big deal to you then the headphones will most likely be good for you.  Beats need to really improve on the mic situation!!!,True,1
B085296FLT,Kelsey,the United States,2025-06-18,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsBetter With Upgrades,"I bought these headphones because I couldn’t find a pair of earbuds that felt comfortable to me and still wanted a similar connectivity to AirPods without spending $500 on the Maxs. Beats offered that while still being the nicest looking in my opinion. The Studio 3s offered nearly everything I was looking for in terms of connectivity, sound quality, and battery life. Where these fell short for me was comfort. Though they definitely were an improvement over earbuds, these still left something to be desired. The earpads were okay, but the band was very uncomfortable to me after around 30 minutes of wear. I was able to rectify this by purchasing aftermarket pads and a headband sleeve that added a significant amount of comfort, as well as enhanced the color. This definitely made my beats something I reach for frequently again, but ideally, they should have been perfect out of the box for the price tag.",True,5

B085296FLT,Donald Carlson,the United States,2025-05-20,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsQuality in Almost Every Piece,"Had these headphones for about 4 years now. Sound is still the same quality you can expect from beats. And it’s still pretty comfortable over all for over ear headphones. They also get the type of loud you’d want from a pair of headphones when you want your music to get ya amped up for something. These definitely hit the right spot. Bluetooth is still amongst the best quality throughout the years when compared to other headphones. Since my head is a little larger, I’ve had to replace the head band that connects at the folding points twice, which is no big deal. It’s mainly because some of the points are small and thin enough to break. Replacement parts are easy to buy which is nice. I’ve also found that the ear muffs might need to be replaced as they end up “melting” (only way I can think to describe it) so I might need to replace those as well, but we will see. Overall the function of these headphones are solid for sure. Battery takes little time to charge and can run for a couple days without needing another charge which is nice. The design I feel could use a little work to have some thickening to specific structural pieces or the band could come in different sizes. Regardless this product is some of the better quality you’ll find for headphones.",True,4

They were OK on a plane despite no noise cancelling - kid was using them and I checked and it wasn’t perfect but you get some protection from the over ear part. In the home they do block a lot of noise and voices at even moderate volume.  I have to uncover one side to hear people. Not sure what makes them so enjoyable to listen to, but the sound is pleasantly distributed over your ears if that makes sense.",True,0

A 5 minute charge will give you 3 hrs. 2 hour charge will give you 65 hrs. The sound quality is super good. They fold nicely. I found an old case of a cheaper pair that I once owned. The case was actually better than those earphones. I'm glad I kept it. Because it fits these new ones perfectly.  So I use it to house these while I'm at work. As soon as I heard the sound quality on these. I ordered and a second pair and Amazon delivered it to my son who lives in Vegas. I sent him some earbuds that I loved like 3 months ago. I told him that he would ditch them after trying these. Needless to say my son is spoiled. He's 26 and I still send him cool gifts. But I KNOW he loves these.

B09LYF2ST7,Honey Badger,the United States,2025-07-24,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsSeems amazing so far :),"When I say so far, I mean I only got it today so I haven't been able to test the longevity of the charge or its durability over time. But for this price, what I have experienced so far is impressive. It was charged fully in 2.5 hours. Probably before that but I didn't check. They are very light and comfortable over the ears. My ears are very sensitive to any kind of prolonged pressure and some headphones like airpods are just impossible for me to wear. Even ones I do consider bearable start to hurt after a short period of time. These felt almost like nothing. Despite their comfort, even without music playing they provided a quiet experience. I had the TV on and could barely hear it with the headphones on. It was very easy to pair (it took a few seconds but did so effortlessly) and the controls are fairly intuitive. The cord may come in handy in the future, so it was a nice bonus.  I also liked the left/right labelling, as it does make a difference and it's usually indicated in the tiniest letters possible, if at all.  This made it simple and straightforward to don. I found there is a definite difference in sound using the equalizer presets, though for my taste the Pop equalizer sounded the best for pretty much all genres of music, ranging from opera to punk and a lot of stuff in between. Sound quality was far better than I anticipated from a $20 headset, certainly on par with those I have spent a lot more money on. If you are looking for inexpensive and GOOD headphones that don't hurt your head and effectively block out noise without the label and price of ""noise-cancelling"" this is your huckleberry.",True,16

B09LYF2ST7,Emily Williams,the United States,2025-07-24,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsDecent. You get what you pay for 💅🏼,"Truly you get what you pay for. Don't come expecting 300 dollar Bose quality. But they work well enough for a basic listening experience. Not noise canceling at all. In fact, they seem to amplify background noise when I have them on sans music. But they get pretty loud, so that can work well enough haha. The fit of the headphones leaves the smallest gap over my left ear, no matter which way I adjust them. So the right side always sounds the slightest bit louder than the left. It is so slight, that probably wouldn't bother most people. But it can really bug me sometimes. The right side fits seamlessly, so I'm sure this is just the way they are made. The ear support is ok, and they stay on my head fine unless I bend all the way over... Then they slide right off. If you are wanting these for the gym, I would say to use them for mild workouts, otherwise you will be frustrated 😵 The set up is easy. A quick pairing connection. One button to change the EQ presets. The bass is average on these. Definitely not the worst I've had, but I'm a bass head, so they do lack a bit. The charging is pretty quick. They fully charge in about 20-25 min and can last a while. I only really use these in the evenings when I clean before bed, so one charge lasts me quite some time. Overall, if you are just needing a cheap pair of headphones that look decent and don't sound horrible, these will do you right 👍🏼",True,3

I have AirPods and I read someone’s review when they said they replaced their AirPods I’m like wtf but now I understand. The songs hit different with these. It really pulls out the background vocals and adlibs in songs. Then it has a “where’s my” app where it records the last place you had them so you never have to worry about losing them. Then you have the app where you can tune and change the EQ download community EQs. I got the red color and they are bussin!! They set up easily and connected with no issues l. I have not tried the waterproofing but I believe it as everything else has been on point or surpassed my expectations. Now I love my head tracking with the AirPods and overall build but I can easily see me swapping to tozo when listening to music or on my ps5. I haven’t tested the phone quality as I don’t plan on using them for those purposes. If I do test I will come and update the review. Touch siding for volume control and they are a perfect fit with many options for different sized ears. Man talk about socks blown off. Unsure what some reviews were thumbing this down for but I guess to each is own but the majority of the world will appreciate these earbuds. I’ll probably be back for another pair.

Thus the app is not usable, and hence no way to adjust the EQ settings other than what the connected device (phone, whatever) has available. The touch controls are also erratic.  Sometimes it will advance a track as requested, other times there is no response.

B0DD41G2NZ,CafeMartin,the United States,2025-07-29,2.0,"2.0 out of 5 starsFrustrating design, unreadable user guide","These earbuds are an example of the sort of design that engineers believe elegant and users find frustrating, if not impossible: a single button or surface is meant to provide the means for many - or all - functions. There are NO buttons; the user is meant to learn from the user guide where on the ear bud surfaces to press. They call it ""Smart Touch."" As for the user guide, the font is so small it cannot be read without magnification, and I don't mean just reading glasses; one needs a magnifying glass or to take photos of the booklet and make the images larger on one's screen. There is no reason for this font size, because there is ample white space for a slightly larger font. The clearances between function areas are so close that merely adjusting the bud position in one's ear sets off multiple functions and warning sounds and shifts the location of the controls. I need my phone to control volume, and generally just swat at the earbuds to start/restart noise cancelling or media play, and this doesn't always work. The charging is fast, but there is just one specific way to place the earbuds so the lid can be closed, and this takes some trial and error. These earbuds are poorly designed. They are seemingly basic earbuds, and yet, there's a learning curve, courtesy of an inadequate user guide that cannot be read without some kind of magnification. I'm using them for sleep, but nothing really keeps them inside - or even on - the ear. So the noise one has blocked out before sleep might still wake the user once the buds have fallen out. My verdict: for the price, they are adequate, but it's worth spending a bit more for a design that makes sense to someone other than the designer.",True,0

There is an optional app that can be downloaded that has an equalizer feature that, when used in a trial mode, seems to have the ability to dial the sound in to your liking. However, to get full functionality of this feature costs $40/year. This seems to give access to more music, but I’m not looking for more music, I just want to listen to what I have.

TOZO was efficient in helping me figure whether or not troubleshooting could fix the issue, and when it did not, they were happy to replace it. The NC9 is not something I'd pick for myself usually as I have smaller ears and the shape didn't fit as well as I'd like, but they connect quickly to my Bluetooth, the sound quality is great, and I enjoy that I can use a USB-C for charging easily rather than a micro-USB. The ANC works well, but I don't love that I have to skip through the transparency mode to get to it, and only being able to use one side to pause/play.

I listen to a very wide range of music and it all sounds incredible. You will hear new things in songs you have heard thousands of times. The range is excellent as well. The warranty is excellent, the features are incredible, the app works very well and is a quality app. It has even updated both these and the NC3s. Getting software updates on the buds at this price was a big surprise. I will never think twice about buying anything Tozo makes as a result of my experiences so far.

I'll say if you want to get the earbuds purely for its battery life, this is the one you wanna go for.  However, this does not detract from the sound quality; the platform on their app displays people's different tuning, and it becomes really impressive with a small tweak to its equalizer.

So, I bought a second pair for my computer, so I could video chat and play video games with friends. This second pair wasn't bad, but wasn't nearly as good as the first pair I bought. Unfortunately, my cat got to the first pair and destroyed the cord, so I decided to just buy a third pair. I bought this pair on July 29th, and as of October 9th, they have basically stopped working, and the sound is garbled and distorted.

B0CQXMXJC5,ItFitzwell,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsBest ANC functionality out of all brands I've ever owned,"This is the best for automatic noise cancellation (ANC) I've ever experienced.  I used Bose ANC over-ear headphones for over a decade, and 2 other brands in the last year.  All were much more expensive than the Anker Q20i, but even though the Q20i cost much less, I wouldn't have liked them so much were it not for the fantastic ANC functionality. I liked the Q20i so much I bought a 2nd pair, so when I forget one pair at work or in the car, I can grab the 2nd pair.  By the way, the quality of the ANC was so striking that I couldn't resist doing a simple experiment and compairing with a pair of my Bose ANC headphones that cost 6x more.  I realize this isn't like a real anechoic-chamber frequency range test ... but I got a metal pan and large metal spoon ... turned the ANC on / off and banged on the pan several times, with both the Q20i vs my Bose headphones.  The elimination of external noise really is dramatic with the Q20i.  That is the most important to me because I get distracted easily with extraneous noises.  Moreover, although over-ear headphones aren't the most comfortable with the head on a pillow at night ... my partner occassionally snores and I found my Q20i's completely eliminate me having to nudge her to get her to roll over. I did see in other reviews some folks are upset over ANC not working in AUX mode with wired connections ... I don't use wired connections so for my bluetooth needs, I'm extremely happy. Finally, one tiny irritant (but too small to drop below 5 stars):  I bought my first pair in July while Prime-Week savings claimed the Q20i's were ""30% Off"" for the Prime sale.  When I bought the 2nd pair a few days later, Prime Week was over, but the 2nd pair was only $1.50 more than the 1st pair.  So perhaps the size of the Prime discount was a bit exaggerated.  Nonethtless, best ANC headphones I've ever owned.",True,0

With the audio on and full noise cancelling I am blissfully unaware of my surroundings. I had noise cancelling earbuds but they really didn't work well so I was skeptical that these budget headphones would be much different. But these work great for me.

I have used them so far to take a phone call and to listen to music and they are excellent. The noise canceling and transparency modes work really well, I am quite surprised.

B0CQXMXJC5,Megan,the United States,2025-07-18,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing NC headphones!,"I bought two sets of NC headphones and the more expensive $80 ones offered none even in NC mode. These are eons better! I also love the color! Even though it says white, it is more like an oatmeal white, very pretty. Next time these go on sale, I plan on buying a back up pair. Pros: Super comfortable from the fit of the ear pieces to the headband. I prefer on ear headphones so over ear, like these, usually aren't comfortable for me, so I was pleasantly surprised. The NC mode works extremely well! As soon as they are on I think it blocks out like 90% of sound before I even play any sound. I have noisy upstairs neighbors who stay between 60-90 decibels loud. So think of a busy, loud restaurant kitchen, that's the base for them above my head. Can't speak to their peak loudness (90 db), but their normal low end (60 db), I didn't hear them thankfully. The volume/loudness is impressive. I have used Jlab neons (they are on ear vs over ear like these) for 5+ years and always had to have my laptop volume up in the high 70 range, usually 77. With these, I majorly had to turn it down to about 44. The sound is really great. I played around with the different modes on the app to get the sound I am used too. So I am thankful for that. I do like the three modes you can easily switch between NC, Normal, and Awareness. I had my mother who has hearing aids try these on and the Awareness mode majorly boosted my voice for her which my vocal range is in the range she has a hard time hearing. I really like that this uses a type C charger. Everything I use requires that so I can just use my phone charger (10ft) if I need to vs searching for a micro usb (I believe) that my old ones used. And these also come with a cord to turn these into a wired version as well. I don't know if you can do that and be able to listen while they charge or not. But if so, even better! My biggest pro is that I can pair these to my laptop (main use) and phone at the same time! This allowed me to keep watching my show while I played with the app on my phone to customize the sound. I just want to mention the color again. A beautiful oatmeal white which makes it more unique. I tend to go for purples and pinks so I went with white just because it was the cheaper option and I am so glad I did! Cons: It automatically reverts to NC mode when you power them on. Not a big deal, but I wish it stayed how I left them when powered off. Button positions. I'm used to buttons on the left earpiece so I am having to relearn/get used to having them on the right. The NC button (which cycles the three modes) is on the opposite side of the same earpiece and is hard to find blindly. I like that it is out of the way so I don't accidentally hit it when powering on/off or volume controls. But I wish it were placed a bit higher so where your finger naturally goes to search for it, it'd find it. My biggest issue, but not enough to knock a star off, are the cues. I'm used to a voice telling me which mode I'm in, power on/off, etc. These ones use a chime that sounds the same for everything, so I have no clue what each chime is telling me until I cycle through enough times or use the app.",True,9

Headphone comfort : fits well on the ears but not over pressured The headset itself is sized too large for smaller heads like mine, I have seen this in other reviews for this product. it fits ok as long as you don't shake your head at all. Sound Quality : Let's face it, if I was after that I would have splurged for the Sony's or Sanhizre""s. The sound quality is good for the price, use the customised eq in the app for the best results. Noise Cancellation : ok tier, not great but it works if you have something on. Fit and Finish : Plastic parts on the ear cups, plastic head rest but metal supports when pulled apart. Its ok. Connectivity : Connects to two devices at a time and switches between them seamlessly, however, if the headphones are turned off, they might have to be re-paired, not a deal breaker but annoying. Overall : A good product for what you pay. Now let's see how long they last.",True,6

My AirPods Pro 2 are currently surviving the ultimate battery test — a 2+ week, cross-country adventure courtesy of the USPS. I had left them at an event about a 100 miles away and my coworker mailed them to me. That's when everything went crazy and USPS lost their marbles, and my AirPods. The post office at times had no idea where they were, but I did through the ""Find My"" app. From South Carolina to Illinois, California, Texas,  Alabama, Georgia, and back again to Alabama, and everywhere in between, these little guys have been bouncing coast-to-coast in a mail truck (or plane, or who-knows-what) and still have battery life left to complain about being lost. They’ve powered through warehouses, sorting centers, and enough zip codes to qualify for frequent flyer status. 22 states and counting. I haven’t seen them in person in over 2 weeks… but they’re still pinging their location. If you’re wondering about real-world battery life and tracking reliability: ... Find My still works ... The case is holding its charge (so far) ... The AirPods themselves? They work great. Just hope I get these back so I don't have to buy another set.

B0D1XD1ZV3,CFortC,the United States,2025-07-30,3.0,"3.0 out of 5 starsHard to fit, workaday audio quality, ANC MIA","I've used three generations of the Bose in-ear monitors over the last 20 years. Their audio quality is flawless and certainly at the audiophile level. However, with the removal of headphone jacks from my last two iPhones, I decided it was finally time to try out wireless earbuds. I did check out what was available in the market and determined that Apple AirPod was the way to go for known quality and integration with the iPhone. Since I also wanted active noise cancellation, the AirPod Pro 2 was the logical and acceptably priced choice. Why the stars rating downgrade? I have not been able to achieve a fit that passes the Apple fit test running on the iPhone. I tried all four sizes of the inserts and struggled with placement in my ears. No joy. I might look into third-party silicone inserts. The second issue might be related to the lack of good fit, but in any case I would judge the audio quality of these Apple AirPods as merely workaday. There is a rough and boomy aspect to the sound. Keep in mind that my decades of listening to the Bose IEM's have spoiled me for their flawless audio quality. I almost forget the third issue: I can hear no active noise cancellation. The background sound is the same regardless of the ANC setting (off, aware, transparent, on). This issue may be related to the poor ear seal. UPDATE for third-party eartips: ""Secure-Fit Premium Eartips for AirPods Pro"" - These are very similar to the Apple originals but feature an additional ""flange"". Substituting these eartips, I find the AirPod Pro sounds smoother and leans more toward an audiophile impression. The iPhone's fit test refuses to run because it fails to detect that the AirPods are inserted in my ears. There is no noticeable improvement in the noise cancellation.",True,0

I brought these as a replacement/ upgrade to an earlier version that battery life is failing. The first day I used them only to listen to music on Spotify. They worked well and did what they needed to do. I listened to music for about 2-1/2 hours and they started to beep. I don't know if that meant the battery was getting low. I thought they had a6 hour battery life... I would say i like the sound better on my soundcore liberty pro earphones better plus it tells you the percentage of battery left which i can't see on the airpods since i am not using an iphone The 2nd time I used them was outside. I was in a mall area, I usually only use one pod at the time when I am in public. I called my mother and I could barely hear her. My volume on my phone was turned to the max and her voice was muffled. I put the 2nd pod in my ear and it did block out the noise around me but her voice was still really low. I looked online to see if there was anything I could do to fix the volume. I get that I am using a Samsung versus Apple but my old airpods don't act like this. I decided to return them.

They’re excellent for all the usual things like music, podcasts, calls (and the noise cancellation is especially clutch on airplanes). I’ve traveled with them a lot, and they make a noticeable difference in reducing plane engine noise … and nearby conversations. What’s maybe a little less common, but really impressive, is using them at live music concerts. I like to protect my ears without sacrificing the sound, and these do a great job. The transparency mode still lets the music breathe, but I can dial the volume back just enough to stay comfortable. They don’t muffle or distort what I’m hearing like regular earplugs do.

B0D1XD1ZV3,D. Martin,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsClose To Perfection!,"The AirPods Pro 2.0 earbuds are very close to perfection. I have four pairs. Two with the lightning connectors, and two with the now standard USB-C connectors. My USB-C pairs have the Mag-Lock charging as well. The sound is awesome! There are earbuds with more bass and higher volumes. But I believe for recreating quality live sound the Airpods produce clear sound that rivals listening to live music. They put out a reasonable amount of bass. I don’t honestly think that folks will be satisfied if you want ear shattering bass. The vocals are crisp. The battery life is pretty darn good too! Even the first pair that I purchased in 2023 still runs for at least 4.5 hours playing music. If the Airpods are totally dead, they’re recharged in about an hour. With the different sized silicone eartips, they will comfortably fit in most ears. Plus when they wear out, you can purchase replacements on Apple’s store, or right here on Amazon. I think one of the best features is the sound dampening ability. I usually have this feature on. I believe that even with no music playing the Airpods cut noise down by at least 50%-70%. You can have the microphones set to when you start talking, they let sounds through. I think the microphones are of wonderful quality. The clarity is really good. It is very rare that someone says they’re having a hard time hearing me. About the only negative is they are susceptible to interference from other devices every once in awhile. This is more prevalent in the summer than in the cooler months. They are discounted now to $169.00! This is much better than paying $249 or even $199. These are the best cordless earbuds I have ever purchased. I would definitely recommend these Airpods Pro 2.0 for the value they are. As I can’t afford $300+ for Seinheiser or Bose products.",True,3

B09CPDSNQM,M,the United States,2025-06-22,3.0,"3.0 out of 5 starsMid quality, decent value.","They aren't anything special quality-wise, but I do like the functions these earbuds have. The main reason that I bought this pair is because they're over-the-ear to avoid constant readjusting and have physical buttons to avoid accidentally activating the touch control when I do adjust them, but the arm over the earlobe doesn't even fit my ears, they just hover over the top of my ear with a lot of clearance. They're still loose on my husband, but the arm's loop is so narrow and the curve so steep that I imagine someone with larger ears might feel uncomfortable pressure on the back of the antihelix after a while. They just seem designed for a very particular ear shape. The replacement tips are a good range of sizes, at least, and I'm very fond of the dedicated volume buttons on each earbud. The sound quality is just... okay. I wouldn't describe it as low-quality, but it's definitely not impressive or particularly crisp. The connection seems stable and I haven't had any random cutout when walking to the next room or putting my phone in my pocket, but if the earbud fairies don't claim this pair, I'll try to update this on how they age. Initial pairing and general use was no trouble, and I'm glad they have the long press for shutoff in case I do run into any. I would recommend these if they're on sale and you are also particular about over-the-ear Bluetooth buds with physical buttons, unless the G17/19s return or someone else with promising reviews steps in to fill the niche. If you're not picky about the combination of shape and controls, I'd probably look for a different brand.",True,0

For the price I  figured that if I drowned these at least I'd have tried. Been using them for months. The sound is better than the old fashioned line plugs. The length of time they hold a charge is unreal. I have yet to sweat through them so maybe it can't be done. They're so soft, well fit and comfortable that I can wear them all day.

The only positive I can give these are the battery life and quick charge. Other than that the sound quality on these are horrible with absolutely no bass. They do not fit in the ear no matter how you angle them or which tip replacement you use.

B07KQ38L2B,D. Hesselbarth,the United States,2025-07-15,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsSolid, comfortable, clear microphone. No one notices I'm using a bluetooth headset.","I have happily used this headset almost daily for four years, paired to an Iphone. Phone calls whether driving or elsewhere: everyone says my voice is strong and clear, compared to many bluetooth headsets that annoyingly pick up and amplify other sounds. Only strong winds have been bothersome. I use the side button to easily activate siri. I listen to podcasts as I walk - again, clear. The volume buttons, though tiny, easily adjust volume. I have worn this all day without discomfort and without the battery running down. Music in one ear? Nothing to shout about. It sounds ok, but I wouldn't buy this primarily to listen to music. The plastic case protects it well. I wouldn't have a headset without a solid case to protect it. The only reason I bought a new one is that the curved rubber earpiece finally cracked apart. That's the end! (though the electronics and battery are still going strong.)",True,0

B07KQ38L2B,wife life,the United States,2025-07-09,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat device for the price!,"This headset is fantastic! I would give it 10 stars if I could! I bought this little thing in 2023 and it’s still going strong! The battery life lasts through a 10 hour work day, making multiple calls with my virtual phone system and taking Teams meetings. The call quality is clear for the most part. I have had a few negative remarks over the years about the call quality but nothing consistent. The battery has died in the middle of my workday maybe 3 times and it seems to be from being in Teams meetings all day. It does stay connected on my laptop through Bluetooth and I have yet to experience connectivity issues. I will say I only use this for work and it is only connected to one device, so I can’t speak to connectivity between multiple devices. It takes about 30 minutes to reach a “full” charge, however I plug it in at the end of my day and leave it until I’m ready to use again the next day or my next shift. So I’m not entirely sure if that contributes to the longevity of the battery throughout the day or not. There is volume control on the device but I seem to have better luck controlling the volume on my laptop. Overall, this device is worth the money and it has definitely lasted. It’s comfortable and lightweight to wear all day.",True,0

I couldn’t be more impressed with the ICOMTOFIT Bluetooth Headset. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell it was built with quality in mind. The sleek black finish looks modern and professional, making it the perfect accessory for business calls or long drives. The Bluetooth 5.0 connection is rock-solid, pairing instantly with my iPhone and staying connected without a hitch. I’ve used it with Android devices too, and it’s just as seamless. The sound quality is crystal clear, both on my end and for the person on the other side of the call. The built-in microphone picks up my voice perfectly—even when I’m in a noisy car or walking outside. One of my favorite features is how comfortable and lightweight it is. I can wear it for hours without any discomfort, and the adjustable ear hook ensures it stays in place no matter what I’m doing. The battery life is phenomenal, easily lasting me through a full day of use on a single charge. Whether I’m taking business calls, using it for hands-free driving, or hopping on quick virtual meetings, the ICOMTOFIT headset has become an essential part of my daily routine. For anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance Bluetooth earpiece that doesn’t compromise on style or function, this is it!",True,1

It comes in a nice little box and it uses a c charger which is awesome cause my other one uses the outdated one. Great value as well.,True,0
B07KQ38L2B,Carlos Terry,the United States,2025-04-08,2.0,2.0 out of 5 stars6 Mos Review,"There have been a few quality issues with this headset that has been exposed over-time. Initially this headset worked great but the Bluetooth distance has been reduced which causes you, the user to sound far-off or muffled if you step 6-8 ft away from PC. The mute button quit working. That battery storage has reduced which causes you to charge more often and sometimes not last a full 8 hour day. This could be managed by shutting the headset off and turning it back on before scheduled usage but for the pop-up calls the headset will not come online within 3-4 rings. You would have miss the call and have to return the call.",True,0
B07KQ38L2B,Litt Family,the United States,2025-04-08,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsThe best Bluetooth device!,When i received the device i was like wow it has its own little case and loved the fact that the charging port is for a C charger and a charger was included with the package. I paired it without any issues and when I speak to people it's crystal clear and they say they can hear me just as well. The battery life is great I walked through Universal Studios using the device the entire day and the battery stayed strong and didn't have an issues. I have a Samsung S24 and this is my new Bluetooth device. I highly recommend it and have ordered one for my 17 year old son that has the same phone as me because he tried it and was so impressed with it capabilities and performance.,True,0

B07KQ38L2B,Scott N.,the United States,2025-04-05,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsGreat price feature packed, great sound, useful buttons, and good design.","I’m very impressed with this headset. I have worked in Human Resources and as a consultant for 9.5 years now using wireless headsets most of the day daily. I have gone through several high and low end headsets in this time. This one is very competitively priced for the quality delivered. The unit is fully ambidextrous and adjustable so you can swivel the ear hook, mic boom, AND the ear bud (which is marvelous) so you can fine tune it to the perfect comfort. The speaker is so loud it initially shocked me and I had to turn down the volume. Sound clarity was as expected for a device made to be a headset rather than headphones, but was clear and not scratchy or distorted at all like I have experienced with much more expensive units. Pairing was a breeze, and apparently it can even be paired to two different devices and switch between them seamlessly!!! Volume buttons are easy to find and intuitive, as is the power button. The mute button is on the bottom (when worn on the right ear) which keeps it perfectly out of the way. The mute button mutes the device solely, and does not activate the mute function on a pc, which is fine but something to be aware of. Microphone tests came back loud and clear and my colleagues reported they could hear me loudly and clearly. The device came in an attractive case which looks like black brushed metal, but is lightweight plastic. In the box was included comprehensive instructions and a short usb-c charging cord. Overall I cannot recommend this product enough. If you are in need of a good business headset, this one is priced far below much higher end models with comparable performance. Fit and finish if the device is noticeably cheaper than say a $200 plantronics headset, but this is expected for the price point, and the device feels sturdy and professional, with tactile and solid buttons and is very comfortable and lightweight. I wore it all day yesterday and forgot I had it on, panicking when I couldn’t find it for a meeting until a notification came through my computer and reminded me I had it on haha. If this is what you’re looking for, then you cant go wrong.",True,4

Sound-wise, these are great. Full, rich sound, and the noise cancelling works really well. They are lightweight and comfortable. I really like the notification features it offers on iPhones. And they look cool. The battery life is ok. They will last maybe a day, more or less, so I recharge often. They do recharge quickly, which is nice. I've been spoiled by my JBL Tune 660s - I use those for work and go days without charging. I don't think those even have a battery - they just run on good music and cosmic positivity. A few weeks ago I noticed a big crack and a missing bit of plastic above the right ear piece. Pulling the headphones open to place on my head exposes the insides. And no, I'm not prying these open like some creaky, old barn doors. You can see that the plastic is very thin. Yesterday I noticed that the left side is also cracked and chipping. At least Beats is consistent from the right to the left. I don't use them in any sort of extreme way that would put extra strain or abuse on the phones (my MMA fighting and bull riding days are a distant memory). This is the first pair of headphones I've owned that are literally falling apart from simple everyday use.

B0C8PR4W22,Kevin H.,the United States,2025-07-28,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Modern Replacement!,"I purchased these headphones to replace an older pair from 2019. I had a great experience with the first pair, so I decided to purchase an updated pair since they were on sale. They are nearly the same size as my previous pair and now features a USB-C port for charging. I am very picky when it comes to headphones as I have large ears and wear glasses. The ear cups cover my ears perfectly and do not press against my ears. They are very durable and seem to be up to par to my previous pair. I'm no audiophile, but I have enjoyed the audio quality these provide using bluetooth with my Apple devices. I read that these headphones have a built-in DAC and can be activated by connecting a USB-C cable to a computer. I did try using the USB-C cable with my Macbook to test lossless and Dolby Atmos with my Apple Music subscription. I can hear subtle differences in quality for some songs, but did not blow me away. I personally think audio quality comes down to encoding, file size, mastering, and the listener's preference. I find myself resorting back to using bluetooth so I am not tied down with a cable. I also tested the noise cancellation feature. I am honestly not a fan of noise cancellation unless I am traveling by plane and want to tune out crying children. It works as advertised- you can turn it on, off, or use a transparent mode to hear your environment. I do recommend these headphones if you are in the market for a good quality, over the ear headphones. I highly advise that you purchase these when they are on sale as I don't think they are worth their normal $300 price tag.",True,0

The second pair had a failed firmware upgrade, and they would not turn on or charge. The third pair developed an intermittent problem with the power button and when noise cancellation was active there was static in the right ear cup.

The headband is extremely tight, enough to trigger a migraine.  And my head is not big.  I was able to fix this by clamping them around the box they came in and blasting the plastic band with a hairdryer until it got hot, then I let them stay on the box until the plastic cooled again. Now they fit nicely. Unfortunately I don't know what to do about the second design failure.  Every time I take these off, I lose a CLUMP of hair.  The seam around the entire ear cushion where it meets the plastic is just wide enough to capture any loose hair and pull it out by the roots.  I will be snatched bald if I continue to wear these. I was also told over a Teams meeting that I sounded like I was underwater, so the mic is apparently sub-par as well. I bought this during Prime Day, so at least I didn't pay full price, but they were still expensive for having such glaring design flaws.  These should have never made it to the shelves.

They don't fit well, are too wide, ear cups do not pivot, not enough pressure on the ear cups to form a seal to block out noise so you absolutely have to use the noise cancelation which is also practically worthless.

Pros y Contras ACCENTUM Plus Pros: mayor autonomía, ANC muy eficaz, EQ de 5 bandas, recarga ultrarrápida, precio más bajo. Contras: sin modo USB-C digital (pierdes audio lossless + mic en ese modo), construcción plástica sin repuestos. Studio Pro Pros: USB-C digital (audio + mic + ANC + carga), bisagras metálicas y pads reemplazables, ANC/Transparencia top, mejor para conferencias. Contras: batería algo menor, precio ligeramente superior. ¿Cuál te conviene? Si valoras sobre todo la batería y una experiencia de sonido “puede todo” por debajo de $150, el ACCENTUM Plus es una compra excelente. Si tu prioridad es la robustez, la conectividad más versátil (audio digital + mic + ANC por USB-C) y un soporte a largo plazo (almohadillas/bisagras reemplazables), quédate con los Beats Studio Pro. De este modo, eliges según tu uso: más horas y EQ fina (Sennheiser) o máxima durabilidad y versatilidad (Beats). Recomendación de compra inmediata: Añade al carrito los Beats Studio Pro (oferta Prime Day o el vendedor oficial). Completa con el cable UGREEN Uno USB-C 100 W 6.6 ft. Con esa dupla tendrás: Micrófono y ANC siempre activos en digital. Audio de máxima fidelidad por USB-C o Bluetooth.

I recently moved to an apartment & found that when I listened to music off of Alexa, the neighbor below was distracted while she was working at home.  Ergo a purchase of wireless headphones was the neighborly thing to do, & I settled on Sony.  As I implied already, the sound is great.

Unfortunately, they stopped working, and I would describe it as a catastrophic failure. To replace the non-functional headphones, I bought a second pair of CH-520s. I am writing this review in mid-July 2025 as a warning because today my second pair of Sony CH-520 headphones also stopped working—completely dead, just like the first pair. The first pair lasted only five months, but my second pair was even less reliable, working for just two months. I don’t believe this is just bad luck; I think it's indicative of a larger issue.

I will say that the build quality of these are surprisingly good. The case is heavy and built solid and the headphones feel very nice. The major downside for me is getting the full audio quality out of them perhaps it is just the shape of my ears but though they are loud I was barely getting any bass from them. I then pushed them up and tight agaiant my ear and suddenly heard the fill range. But they are not going to sit that snug with normal use so I think it is simply a design flaw around the location of the base output. My previous, cheaper earbuds fit into your upper ear as well and were more effective at delivering the full bass. So despite these feeling very nice for the price, I will most likely be returning them.",True,0

The part that wraps around the ear itself is flexible and super comfortable, theyve never slipped out! But my one issue is that the thick bulbous plastic part right under the earbud part will hurt the inner part of my ear if worn for several hours. It happens often that i'll have to switch sides because one side starts to pulse and i can physically feel the inside being slightly inflamed for a few days. This also has nothing to do with the volume either. Not sure if I'm wearing them at a wrong angle, but it feels like I've tried several angles and the issue persists. Other than that, these would be perfect. Its also not an earbud cover size issue either. That said I would recomend these for those who want an affordable alternative to annoying airpod style earbuds that fall out all the time. They also are small enough that my work allows me to wear them during my shift opposed to my big over the ear headphones.",True,2

Furthermore, it wouldn't recharge, although the metal contacts were clean. It would begin to charge for a few seconds and then it would stop. Going thru its 1-star reviews I noticed several other customers with the exact same issue, one of them actually posted a short video showing what happens - same as mine. Because two months had passed since I got it, I didn't have the option to return/refund but, being persistent, I chatted with Amazon's customer service and, ta-da!, they accepted my return request and I already got my refund. Looking for a new pair of earbuds in the same price range ($25-$30) I found many unhappy customer reviews complaining about the same issue from other brands. My guess is that the parts for these devices are probably made by the same company in China that sell them to different brands. When you purchase something at this price you can't expect high quality - some will be defective. I already got a new one, same good sound quality, fits well in my ears and I'm happy again.

B0CSXV3GK4,carol thomas,the United States,2025-07-28,2.0,2.0 out of 5 starsThe Problem: I Believed The Pitch! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"The 3:00 AM Original Review: The WORST earbuds I have EVER bought! If I got them for free, I would still be disappointed! It is 2:48 AM. I battle insomnia. My other earbud’s battery unexpectedly died after a few hours. I tried these again. HORRIBLE! No noise reduction. Volume control AND levels are HORRIFIC. Bass is null! Maybe I am missing a button on this device to make them work correctly. However, the reality is THEY DO NOT have a make them better button. Above all, I ONLY use them to listen to documentaries and speaking podcasts and the sound is beyond HORRIBLE! They even exaggerate background sounds because they pick up background ambient sounds to the extent that those sounds are louder than the podcast volume UNLESS the volume on my iPhone is nearly on the highest volume level. What does this mean? It means one word describes this product best: CRAP! Sadly, I purchased them as a birthday gift. So, here I am WIDE AWAKE at 3:00 AM trying to fall back to sleep with a headband wrapped around my head, in the summer, TRYING to make these earbuds block out ambient noises. How I am going to work later this morning will be a challenge! I cannot hate these earbuds any more than I do, especially right now! And this is maybe the third time I used them since purchasing them just under a month ago. And, yes, that means during the past three weeks I AVOID using them unless I absolutely have to use this crappy product! Absolutely pathetic! UPDATE: Tried smaller ear tips, hours later during the day, while reading a Kindle book with a Brown Noise app playing ocean sounds. After twenty minutes of using them, and the volume on MAX to silence the sound of a small fan in my room, the earbuds will be counted as a LOSS! They are going in the trash! Any person qualifying this product as a five star version of earbuds is seriously deprived. This product’s sound is equivalent to the 1980s Walkman headphones; the ones on sale at the “5 & 10” store. Sorry. If this product did not advertise “noise canceling” and “extra bass,” I would NOT be so perturbed. However, since they did, I qualify such claims as NONSENSE!

For some odd reason with this pair of buds they switch to FULL VOLUME when a call comes in. I was listening to a podcast, got a call and almost blew out an ear drum. I thought I had done something wrong but it happened twice. Truth be told, I have several pairs I use for work and pleasure. I was looking for a pair with a better mic than the Back Bay pair that I use outdoors. While this pair seemed ok to those on the other end, the noise cancellation isn't that good and the lack of controls is annoying. You can control the volume for a phone call with the buds and the absurd high volume on the switch over from a listening to a phone call is really bad and can be dangerous. I currently use a set of Back Bay buds and a pair of Raycons.  My best pair were Bose Sound Sports Buds, which recently quit. I turned to multiple pairs because the thought of wearing a  $200 of buds digging in the dirt just doesn't seem like a great idea.

I have some headphones and these earbuds payed with my phone. Whenever I 'turn off' the earbuds by putting them into the case to charge but continue to use my headphones, the earbuds do not turn off and reconnect with the headphones from within the closed case (!), which makes the headphone transmission stop. I often have this happen every 5-10 minutes: the Bluetooth manager of the phone lists my headphones as connected, the sounds goes off, and the Bluetooth manager of the phone lists my headphones AND the earbuds as connected as well. Apparently, the earbuds wait for connections even when supposedly off, which also means they often don't last as long.

The louder/plus/next track/power ON direction of buttons and slide switches should be AWAY from your head! The vibration and volume up/down tone is waaaaay too strong and too loud! The reception range of this headset is much, much shorter than the SX-991. You walk away 12 ft and it starts nagging you with voice prompt.

These will show 70%, and then die within 3 hours in the middle of the night,  which walks need up. The other ones,  at 70% meant I had 2 to 3 more days before being a recharge.

The second pair had one of the earbuds stop working.  The reason I believe was because of the retractable wire.  I was letting the wires retract on their own and the spring mechanism is pretty strong.  So, it would SNAP back causing stress on the thin earbud wires.  After about a year or so of use one of the earbuds stopped working. If I get another pair I will not do that again and will hold on while they retract to prevent the stress on the wires.

I've had more expensive brands that sound much worse and flatter in comparison. If there's one complaint: It's the build quality. I had the left ear just sort of wear out, give way, and not rest against my ear correctly anymore. The company actually came through and replaced them just shy of two years later! They actually stood by the warranty and didn't even fight. Most companies would have tried to play the blame game especially given what happened and how close it was. Sometimes getting them to connect can be kind of finicky if you have them paired to more than a few devices. They seem to be able to change automatically depending on which source is outputting sound at any given time. I really like the fact that they're wired too. That means I can hook them into my amp sim pedal to play guitar. They charge relatively quick given you use a good enough cable. Cheap cables seem to not allow them to charge as quickly. Beware of this. Some people seem to think it's a defect, but changing which cable you're using can make all the difference. I experienced this myself. If it weren't for the left ear wearing out so easily, 5/5, especially given the price to sound quality ratio.",True,0

Really like the cushions on them and the sound is pretty good for the price. They worked well on the flight and are light weight.

I used them with a Bluetooth transmitter plugged into the movie screen on the plane and like that the cord can be completely disconnected to use the Bluetooth feature.

B07MQQS88Q,Randy,the United States,2025-06-15,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 starsWell, they work, but not as expected","The main reason I bought these was that they can be corded or Bluetooth. I first charged them overnight, in the morning the light should have gone from red to blue, it did not change. The only way I saw that they where fully charged is when I paired them with my phone. OneOdio does have an App, to bad it will not work with the A70. Description says they have a built in microphone, this is NOT TRUE. There is NO Mic in the headset. The only Mic you have is when you use the 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm lead. Another reason I got these was to Bluetooth to my PS5. They will NOT pair to a PS5. PS5 knows there are there, but comes back and says these are incompatible. But, the 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm lead does work when plugged into the controller. The volume was really load, I had to drop my chat volume in the PS5 to zero, then it was better. The other people I was talking to said the sound from me was much better and clearer then the other headset I was using. The + and - buttons for volume ONLY work while paired to a device in Bluetooth. If you use a cord, then the external device will need to control the volume. The volume level and sound quality was really good. They are very light on the head and ear muffs are comfortable.",True,1

B07MQQS88Q,G-Man,the United States,2025-06-07,1.0,1.0 out of 5 starsThey failed the charging test.,"These headphones simply are very challenging to charge.  You will plug them in and suddenly you check on them and the charging light is off.  You can reinsert the cable and the light will go back on only to go off when you walk away.  After several tries over a day or so they will finally charge.  I noticed that if I get a connection I can't move the cord at all or the light will go out.  This has happened since day one.  As far as design, I don't like the fact that you have to locate the center button to turn them on which is inbetween two other buttons. You find yourself ""feeling around"" like trying to read brail with your fingers.  It's hard to find it with the phones on your head.  Others that I owned had a dedicated power button by itself.

Literal, los cargué el lunes y hoy jueves todavía siguen vivos 🔋🔥 • Me encanta que puedo usarlos con cable USB-C o 3.5mm si me quedo sin batería (que no ha pasado aún). • Se conectan rápido a mi iPhone y también a mi laptop sin problema. 🔁 Lo que mejoraría: • Después de un rato largo puestos, se sienten un poco apretados (no son los más cómodos para tener todo el día). • No tienen cancelación de ruido activa, pero si los usas en casa o en la oficina están perfectos. 🎶 Para música, llamadas, podcasts y hasta videos en Netflix, me han encantado.

B0CZPGX972,Clayton Barnes,the United States,2025-07-27,2.0,2.0 out of 5 starsWhite / pink unconnecting Beats Solo 4,Between two people we’ve had 4 Beats Solo 3 headphones. That generation wasn’t available anymore and both of us had to get these Beats Solo 4 - one in black and the other in this color. This color looks like a concentrated matte pink but it’s actually just white with a tinge of soft pink. The sound quality is a little painful. It “scans your ears for optimal use” & becomes the equivalent of those ultra hd tvs. The sound is somehow deep and super distant. They are more comfortable and require less break in but the color isn’t as advertised albeit maybe more palatable & I just really miss my old ones. Charging is inconvenient and after a month it isn’t connecting,True,0

However, this specific product has several problems: 1. The volume fluctuates a lot, sometimes I can barely hear things even though I tune the volume to maximum. But most of the time, it works at 30% for the same APP and song. 2. The battery is very confusing. It would show 70% (battery level medium) for days. However, when it goes to 30% (low), it only stays alive for ~30min. 3. The above are not huge problems. What's fatal is the fragile junction. I have used SX-990, a previous model, for 2 years without any problem. However, this upgraded version, SX-991, only lasts for six months under the same level of caution. I wish I had bought another SX-990 instead. It was ~$10 cheaper, too.",True,0

Neither of them recognize these Bluetooth headphones (doesn't even come up as an option).  Too bad we missed our return window.  My son just brought them to me to pair a couple days ago.

B07FGFNP48,JCB,the United States,2025-02-24,1.0,1.0 out of 5 starsAn older version (2024 ) Calls made or received can't be heard unless turning on/off device.,"Update to review:  This has been used more for listening to A/V rather than phone calls.  Have noticed on phone calls after some trouble shooting to ensure it's not system settings that I can be heard but cannot hear the caller on the other end without first turning off the device and reconnecting which is obviously highly annoying and failure of the product.  It's also noticed when making a call.  When calling there is an unusual delay on if the call is actually going through.  It's not immediate then it will connect with same result of unable to hear the caller.  Again, turn off and on the device while in call and then it works correctly.  I purchased an identical style of headset yet different brand name and it works perfectly so it is this headset.  Unknown at this time if there is any warranty past the 30 days on this device.  Unless just using it to listen rather than for calls it works fine but may have to junk it in favor of the other reliable brand. This model is an older model purchased before purchasing the 2024 version as it is marketed but generally the overall quality and usage of the device is the same. Ear buds that can be easily lost are the least preferred so the neckband types are most suitable to preference.  Some smaller profile neckbands were purchased in the past and have worked well so this was an attempt to try a little bit different style since the earbuds retract rather than those that connect magnetically to the neckband also leaving wiring exposed. There are tradeoffs.  these are a bit cleaner and easier and wiring and given the retractable earbuds but they are a bit bulkier as a result and less forgiving in flexibility.  They do fold for easy storage which may make traveling with them a little easier as they do come with a nice zippered case that stores the headset and the charging cable.  I also like the fact that it can be used for other purposes if not for use with the headset. They are thicker to house the retractable feature so a little less forgiving in the flexibility as some of the other headsets with magnetic earbud storage.  The charging connector is on the bottom of the headset.  That could matter depending on your charging habits and how it may rest while being charged but not a factor here one way or the other.  There are different colors (and at different prices as a result).  Since I have other previous models similar in function getting used to these buttons took a little time but seems now natural to adjust to them.  I do like the actual on/off switch as opposed to the type that require holding a button for a few seconds to power on and off.  The latter sometimes makes it difficult to know when it's turned off or having to listen through the earbud whether it was turned on or off. The battery life seems way better than what I am accustomed to with some other models.  Charging is usually done overnight or when low and a second set is alternated so length of charge doesn't cause any concerns.  There are two buttons one on each side to retract each ear bud.  To use just pull on the ear bud the desired length and press the button to easily retract.  So far it has not failed to retract.  Sometimes listening to podcasts only one ear bud is used at a time so nice that one is retracted while the other is in use. Overall I do like the functionality of this headset but do wish it was just a little less bulkier.",True,0

B07FGFNP48,Kate Barlow,the United States,2025-02-01,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsSwivel fold breaks easily,"As far as the sound and long life of the battery goes, it's wonderful. The only issue is the swivel part where you fold is plastic and not very sturdy, once it breaks you can't wear it around your neck unless you tape it, and if you tape it, you can't fold it. So, these lasted me 6+ months. I really thought I'd found the best. I really like these. But that is 2 sets broken at the swivel part in less than a year. Needs to be studier material.",True,0

B07FGFNP48,Nicolette,the United States,2025-01-17,2.0,2.0 out of 5 starsVoice announcing the callers phone number,"I actually really liked this headset. After trying out five headsets for my office desk phone. When I opened the package and began to use it, I thought I had finally found a headset that worked for me. Pairing it is simple, there are different earpads available, and a case is included for transporting everything. The headset was charged and very easy to sync with my desk phone. However, the sound quality was subpar. It sounded like the people were in a tunnel. The reason I returned them is that when receiving a call, the headset announces the number: 555-555-5555. When this occurred, the caller was unable to hear me until they read the phone number. I sent a message to the seller, who replied immediately. They said that if I wanted to replace it because of the sound quality, they would send a new headset. They said I would receive a full refund and did not need to return the headset, but I did. Unfortunately, the announcement could not be modified. I really thought this would work but the phone number being announced really did not work for me. I returned the headset.",True,0

The headset is a little stiff and depending on the size of your neck it may feel a little tight. I have had this headset for about 57 days and the volume buttons have been an issue and no longer work at all. The battery lasts a very long time. The one large button on the right is very convenient. It does take a little time to get used to using the retraction buttons to retract the earbuds. I just learned that I didn't understand the 2 functions of the volume buttons thus I have changed my rating to 5 stars. To change the volume using the volume buttons you have to hold them vice just clicking them once which jumps what you are listening to forward or backward.,True,0

B07FGFNP48,Honest review bc your money is important,the United States,2024-02-27,2.0,2.0 out of 5 starsear buds do not stay in,"comes with a great case- great to protect it in the backpack, however the problem with the design is in the ear buds on a retractable cord. The cord pulls on the buds and they keep falling out- so, what's the point of using these then? They need to revamp the design so that speakers are in the piece along your neck and you do not need to put ear buds in, or have some kind of wrap feature on the buds so they stay next to your ear. As is, this product is worthless.",True,0

I have multiple ear piercings on one ear that make it difficult to use the Apple air pods comfortably and I can wear these with ease. The sound quality is also in my opinion way better than the air pods. They block out outside noise as well.

B0CX1SZPH3,VS,the United States,2025-07-23,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsIneffective noise cancellation,"I was sold on this product by a promotional review, but it was underwhelming. I could only connect it to my Android phone, but not to my Mac. Furthermore, the quality of noise cancellation is very poor, compared to say the Tozo NC9, which is in a similar price range and offers active noise cancellation. This particular pair of earbuds does not have ANC capabilities. That said, the weight, fit and comfort were all good. The volume control is very clunky and unreliable. I did not test the microphone capability. Pairing with the phone was easy, as noted above, pairing with the Mac did not work. The earbuds do not come with a companion app, and there is no obvious way to change the sound profiles. I had only considered this product because unlike the Tozo NC9 which does not have multi-device support, the Amazon AI (Rufus?) suggested that this product can be connected to more than one device. Overall, probably decent for exercising, walking, running, but not very impressive.  Your mileage may vary.",True,0

B0CX1SZPH3,Jasmine,the United States,2025-07-20,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsNot the best and not the worst.,"I just received my ear buds today. They did come fully charged and well packaged. Unfortunately, I've decided to return them after finding another pair this evening. The sound quality is nice, but I think I can find a little better. They don't have an on board EQ and the new one I found has that and an interactive case where you can choose options and even has a locator device if you lose them. Don't get me wrong, these are not bad headphones, but one side doesn't fit my ear real well. It's a problem i often have with certain headphones. They also didn't come with the 3 different size ear tips. They were all the same so I couldn't change it out for a better fit. They did hold a charge for several hours. At the price I paid they were worth it being on sale, but I wouldn't say they are much better that my $29 JBL's. If I had paid the original price for them, I'd definitely return them. I guess i was a little disappointed, but I'm pretty fussy about my ear buds since I listen to music and podcasts all day every day. For the sale price of $19.99 they're fine.",True,1

After using them for a bit now, I think $19.99 should be the regular price. These are not $100 earbuds. Yes they have pretty good sound quality with good bass like others have mentioned but I thought these were actual noise canceling earbuds for music. I guess I misread the description at the top. Only the mic is noise canceling. It does not block out outside noise when listening to music. I will say one good thing about these. They come with a lifetime warranty.

If I was to pick one word to describe these headphones, the word would be ""garbage"". While they are really cheap selling at $14.99, they are worth $14.99 less than that. Here are the reasons why. The bass on these headphones is unacceptably muddy. The mids and highs are also unacceptable. The eq button on these headphones is just ornamental and does nothing. These headphones are adequately comfortable to wear, but everything about the audio is really subpar. While I advocate not spending a lot of money on headphones, because they all will eventually fail, I will look elsewhere for inexpensive headphones because these headphones are junk.",True,2

B09NNBBY8F,Miss K,the United States,2025-06-24,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsThey're nice headphones.,"These headphones served me well. I've had them for a while now but they're starting to wear out. The most frustrating thing about these headphones is that I can't figure out how to remove the cushions to replace them since they started to flake and look kind of ugly. They don't take long to charge, even after years of use. They'll probably fit your head just fine since its got an adjustable headband. I wouldn't call these ""noise cancelling"" but if you're listening to something with a high enough volume, you might not hear a few things. I haven't used the wire/mic that comes with the product but it's probably your average microphone quality (you'd be better off finding a different one). The cord is fairly long though. The pink is super cute. I've dropped them a few times but it didn't fall apart. It has a couple of different modes you can cycle to but I've stuck to one pretty much ever since I've gotten them. They do change how the audio plays though, so find what's best for your needs. My only issue with the headphones is the cosmetic wear, otherwise they're still as good as when I first got it. I'd say, go for it! They were nice for the price I got it. They're a lot more comfortable than some other headphones I've used.",True,1

B09YLFHFDW,Steve,the United States,2025-07-19,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsEasily my go-to for budget bluetooth earbuds,"This is actually my *third* pair of WI-C100s- the first pair lasted a good several months (if not over a year) but the cable from the battery to the earbud came loose on one side; the second I lost on the way to work after months of use, probably while having to run for a bus or snagged on my backpack strap and fell off (was...not a good morning hah) So....yes, since they're so light they are easy to slip off accidentally if you don't have one or both ears in-use to keep it from running off your neck (mostly when running or leaning/laying back, basic day-to-day activities don't usually knock em loose ime) that's really the only ""big"" downside I've found so far across these- and I've been using this same model for a few years now. And worst case scenario, if you do lose em they're cheap and easy to replace, widely available- sometimes even at local stores (though my nearby places didn't this time around) Because they're tethered together, I don't have to worry about losing one ear because it fell out mid-use or I forgot to put it back into the case when not in use. Sometimes you may need to be careful using these when wearing any ""cross-chest strap"" bags or otherwise (messenger/gym/duffel bags, purses, arm-slings, tools with a neck/shoulder strap, etc) to make sure the earbuds don't get caught under the strap- but for the tradeoff of reliability and peace-of-mind of having them semi-wired, I don't mind that occasional snag too much. Even when they do lightly catch on my backpack strap, they haven't seemed to wear down or come loose around the wire at either end (the pair I had that *did* break in that way came loose at the battery end, and wasn't caused by a shoulder strap- was also after several months of heavy use, even while sleeping) So build quality is reasonable, how do they sound? Honestly, for a $20-30 pair of *wireless* earbuds, pretty decent ^-^ sure it may not satisfy any audiophiles, but again....don't forget the price- even for that, they still sound great to me (of course, that could just be Sony and their reasonable consistency/quality with even budget headphones over the years heh) and the extra features from the Sound Connect app are a nice bonus. Of course it's not going to have extra-thumpy bass (try their ""XB"" line of products for that) or Sennheiser/Bose/what-have-you quality- but the equalizer and DSEE do give you some extra control over how they sound. Oh, and you can also enable/disable the voice msgs from the app, so it'll only speak up when turning on/off the headset, and when the battery is low The connection consistency and quality have been pretty good across all 3 pairs I've had. For reference, I not only use them with my phone daily (close proximity, but also connecting to Android over BT often works better than with Windows) but also with my PC just as often- and I've never had a problem with initial pairing or swapping between the two. When in use with my PC, even when in another room several ft away they still maintain a good connection, only *rarely* drops out from far away if I move my arm in the way of the line-of-sight (granted, that may also be another advantage of the ""pair on the same wire"" style of headset over individual or TWS [true wireless sound, or ""airpod style"" with the separate batteries/bt connections per ear] buds- ymmv with your device(s) of choice) The battery life....hoo boy, they're not kidding when they say upwards of 20-25 hrs. Not only do these have a larger battery thanks to the type of headset- but also since the battery is along the band instead of the buds themselves, the earbuds are much lower profile and work great for wearing during sleep without having to worry about them falling out or losing charge too soon (as long as you don't mind the wires- but even then, they're pretty lightweight and unobtrusive) especially with the right eartips to help keep em snug and secure. Personally, with my living situation having something playing in my ears to drown out outside noise while sleeping was....a necessity- with some memory foam eartips (the included ones would normally be ok, but my inner ear is a bit wide even for the included large tips to work ._.) you almost don't need active noise-cancelling with these ^-^ speaking of eartips, the posts on these are also decently long unlike most TWS buds, so they have a bit more flexibility with options for those (one of my major problems with several TWS pairs I've tried) Between the long battery life (and decently fast charging speed, even over a PC USB instead of 2A wall adapter), comfortable wear, decent sound quality for price, and extra features in the companion app, I'm pretty happy with these as a daily driver (As for the provided eartips, there's nothing wrong with em and will likely work for most, I'm just a bit of an odd case with ear shape hah)",True,0

Has the quickest and farthest Bluetooth connection I've seen, even compared to other headphones and speakers. Probably the best sound quality for ear buds that I've experienced. Very comfortable and light, with a battery that I've gotten to last over 20 hours, great for long work shifts. The controller is very basic. Pause/play, next, previous, volume up and down. Easy to lose, can fall into cracks and get lost in unkempt wires, but it is kinda hard to tangle. Not the best for extreme activity, I like to use them at work where I can lift, walk and sit.

B09YLFHFDW,wali h,the United States,2025-05-15,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat wireless neckband earphones with a couple shortcomings,"I've used its cousin, the WI-C130, for the past two years and felt like it was about time to replace them given their waning battery life. I've used those out and about, listening to music and, most importantly, while lying in bed listening to audiobooks (including side-sleeping). Most earphones aren't comfortable for that; either they poke out too much, are generally uncomfortable, or too loose/unsecure. But these (both C100 and C130) are amazingly comfortable for that use-case. The WI-C100 is comparable to WI-C130. Given Sony's notoriously confusing naming scheme, its not clear which of the models is meant to be a step-up over the other. - In minor aspects of build quality, the WI-C130 seems better; slightly better quality plastic with magnets (at least weak ones) on the eartips for convenient attaching when not in use. - But otherwise, the WI-C100 seems better; the sound quality (from initial impressions) and the availability of software preferences. E.g., after initial connection with an android smartphone, it prompts you to install the Sony SoundConnect app which has a nice equalizer with a ""clear bass"" option. It also includes helpful guides on the button functionality and choosing the right sized eartips for your ears. It also includes (what seems like) a gimmick feature: a ""360 live sound"" app which simulates surround sound and adapts it to a model of your ear shape. I'm not sure whether this applies globally, or only in the small collection of paid bloatware apps it offers to install. The app could've been more polished, and if the 360 live sound thingy was better implemented, it would definitely outcompete other such branded apps. Two important shortcomings: - These should've had multipoint bluetooth connections so that at least two devices could be connected at a time. It seems they could've implemented that in this package, esp. at this price-point. - These don't automatically turn off after a timeout period when there's no sound. I suspect this needlessly shortens their battery health overtime, like it does for the WI-C130, especially when used during sleep time. Its a shame because an automatic-switch-off feature would've made these even more robust and long-lasting. TL;DR: In the relatively overlooked niche of wireless neckband earphones, this is a very decent, economical option, providing Sony-level sound quality and reliability. (Having said that, the WI-C130s were $18 two years ago, now these comparable WI-C100s are almost double the price. That's regrettable especially since the cheap plastic build quality is nothing to write home about, also with the two shortcomings above. There are other companies providing more features at this price-point (albeit without the Sony-level comfort). I hope Sony limits price-hikes for these and related models, or at least justifies them with tangible improvements in build quality, sound, IP rating, battery life, QoL features, etc). Bonus tip: cross the earphones around the neck for a more secure fit. This advice goes for most wireless earphones with neckbands.",True,24

B0DGHMNQ5Z,Matt,the United States,2025-07-26,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsApple just does it better,"These are pretty unreal for the price. The wireless earbud market in current year is a mess, heaps of overpriced garbage offerings being released and nobody can release a pair of earbuds that are just perfect. I used these first on Android (moving to iPhone later this year because I'm tired of the AI crap being pushed in today's tech and I know right now I can rely on Apple intelligence to do barely anything meaningful and be too half baked to do anything with my data). I was unsure of myself because in most every instance these sounded better and more pleasant than anything else I have using higher resolution codecs (of which I have several THOUSAND dollars worth of wireless earbuds, yes it is a problem thank you for your concern, admitting is the first step.) Listening on an iOS device obviously sounded slightly better. Apple can produce more accurate bass on a pair of earbuds that don't seal using an AAC codec than Sony can on their flagship earbuds with their own LDAC codec. Mind you, Sony is incompetent and can't make a good audio product anymore even at 3x the price so that comparison might not have been fair. Yet it doesn't stop there, the more offerings you compare it to the sadder it gets. Companies have gotten lazy, bass takes a lot of power to drive so instead of optimizing the driver and power efficiency, bass algorithms are pushed instead to give the ""feel"" of more bass, but never an accurate representation of what bass sounds like, they're often terrible and distort the bass as a result leaving you with something that sounds and feels different. This left me puzzled, airpods are often critized for their lack of bass, yet these hum beautifully and more importantly, true to wired for a pair that again doesn't seal your ears. I've come to realize the deaf and those hard of hearing can post comments on the internet and they are also those that would look at a pair of skull candy crusher evo's and think ""did they make these for me?"" I am glad for once with Apples policy of not listening to people and continually just doing what they want because they have something killer here that should not be tainted by the unwashed masses incorrect opinion. Mids and treble? Airy but forward and clear with a little sparkle, a man cannot ask for more, because again these things don't actually seal your ears so they in turn sound more open, that's the point.

B0BFQS8236,Lola’s Mom,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsComfy, durable, and sound really good too","If you need a headset that cancels a good amount of noise but can’t use the pods because they just won’t stay in your ears, then this is the headset for you. Even if you can use the pods, but you’re in need of a new pair, this headset is a great option. I was concerned about the quality, given the low price. But I’ve been using them for almost 8 months, almost on a daily basis, and they’re still working great. I like that I can be active and not worry about them falling out. I work from home, and these do a great job cancelling out the day to day noise distractions. The pod itself fits quite comfortably in my ear. They came with several different size covers to make for a more customized fit. The piece that goes around the back of the ear is comfortable. I can wear these for several hours without any discomfort. The sound quality is surprisingly good, given the low price point. The case is no bigger than other pod cases, it’s just a different shape. I do like the window on the case that lets you know how much charge the earphones have. The only issue I have is a very minor issue, not worth losing a star for. I wish that the R and L markings were a little easier to see.  If you’re putting in the pods right from the case, it’s not a problem, but if you’re like me and you’re working, and you throw the pods on the table, or when  you put them in your bag without the case, when it comes time to use them again, it’s a little difficult to identify, which is right in which is left. Again not a huge deal and it’s a great possibility you might not have an issue. I just felt like they could’ve been marked a little better. But overall, he’s a great pair of earbuds. They connected easily to the Bluetooth on my phone and my laptop, noise reduction is very good and sound quality is very good too. I am terrible when it comes to losing and breaking earbuds so the fact that I’ve been able to hold onto this pair for seven months is a small miracle. These pods are holding up to the torture that I put them through, while sounding quite good. I am Pleasantly surprised and very happy that I purchased these",True,0

The only complaint I have is that the controls on the body take only the slightest touch and provide no haptic feedback.

Does this company realize selling products that break quickly, with rapid planned obsolescence is tantamount to simple theft? the other headphones that also mechanically broke after only owning for a little over a year were the WH-1000XM4 version cannot recommend these until sony 1. acknowledges the issues 2. fixes them",True,0
B0BS1QCFHX,Patience,the United States,2025-07-24,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Performance and Sound.,"I purchased the WH-CH720N Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Over The Ear Headset with Microphone (with Alexa built-in) approximately one month ago.  As such, I have had a decent amount of time to use it and develop an informed opinion on them.  I have been pleasantly surprised that it performs precisely as it boasts; clear, crisp sound with effective noise canceling.  I used it to listen to music, make phone calls, and perhaps uniquely-to plug into my electric drum set while practicing.  For all of these uses it performs very well, and has the added advantage of being easy to use. I bought these during the “Amazon Prime Days”, so I enjoyed the further benefit of a great deal.  In sum, these headphones were a good, economical purchase which has delivered the sound and utility I was hoping for.  I would recommend them to anyone searching for good, fairly inexpensive and highly functional headphones.",True,0

I got these to replace my Anker Soundcore over-the-ear headphones -- as you can see, the Souncore ones falling a part after a couple of years. But these Sony WH-CH720N headphones aren't the same quality. I paid for the brand name, thinking the sound quality, style, and design would be an upgrade. They are not. I'm not sure if these are considered lower-tier headphones for Sony, but I'm not satisfied with a more-than-$100 price tag for these compared to my existing headphones that cost way less. The sound quality is subpar with little bass. I like bass. These are very lightweight in size and apparently quality. They feel cheap. They're easy to use. The Bluetooth feature worked easily enough and connected to my devices. I didn't test the mic because I knew immediately these were not the headphones for me. Money NOT well spent.

The sound quality is noticeably underwhelming—flat, lacking depth, and with very little clarity in the highs or punch in the bass. Even more frustrating is the volume limitation; they simply don’t get loud enough, even when paired with devices at full volume. For anyone who enjoys immersive audio or listens in noisier environments, these headphones fall short. While the noise canceling is decent and the design is lightweight and comfortable, those positives are overshadowed by the weak audio performance.

B0BS1QCFHX,Danny C.,the United States,2025-07-17,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsThese Headphones Are My New ‘I Can’t Hear You’ Button,"Okay, let me tell you something: I’ve owned headphones before, but none have made me feel like I’m living in the future quite like these Sony WH-CH720N’s. I threw them on, hit play, and suddenly the world went quiet—like really quiet. I’m talking about that kind of peace where you wonder if someone switched your life to airplane mode. It’s like they have a built-in “peace and quiet” button, and honestly, I didn’t know how much I needed it until I tried them. The sound quality? Chef’s kiss. I’m no audiophile, but when I say these things make your music feel like it’s floating around you, I mean it. I don’t know what kind of sorcery is going on inside these headphones, but the bass hits just right, the mids are crisp, and everything feels balanced. It’s like listening to your favorite tunes for the first time again. If I could marry a pair of headphones, this would be my soulmate. And let’s talk about that noise-canceling feature. I’ve tried noise-canceling before, but this? This is the real deal. The outside world? Gone. It’s like putting on a cozy, soundproof blanket around your ears. I could be in the middle of a crowded coffee shop, and it’d be just me and my playlist. It’s so good, I found myself laughing at how much I didn’t know about the noise around me until it vanished. Comfort-wise, I’m impressed. I’ve worn these for hours without feeling like I’m wearing a vice on my head. The ear cups are soft enough that it feels like they’re hugging my ears, but not too tight to give me a headache. Plus, the adjustable headband means they actually stay on my head without making me look like a bobblehead. Huge win. Battery life? Out of this world. I’m talking 35 hours of playtime, which means I can listen to music all day, every day, without having to charge them like I do with my other devices. This is exactly what I need when I’m on a long road trip or just getting lost in my favorite playlist. In short, if you’re looking for headphones that’ll make you forget the world exists (in the best way), these Sony headphones are the real deal. Comfort, sound, and noise-canceling? They’ve got it all. Seriously, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.",True,3

My reason for 3 stars though, is the fit. Maybe Im not picky but the way these sit on the head is NOT cute. i wanted a sleek, cute headphone set for the gym and work, but becuase the band comes out from the outside of the ear muffs, they go out weirdly and make your head look funny. Ended up switching these out for the WXM4s. However, if you are looking for a pair of cheap headphones that are very functional, and care less about aesthetic, these are a great option.",True,0

The noise cancelling component is great for when I am locking in on my studies and I like that you can turn on ambient sound to kinda hear whats going on around you.  Bluetooth is easy to connect. My favorite part of these might be the sony app. It allows you to configure your music based on what you like. So basically you can turn the base up or down based on your preferences.

Another thing is, the build quality. It’s really light, which I enjoy but, it feels cheap and it does not fold. The connectivity is awesome, you can connect up to two devices at once but you will have to tinker a little bit in order the app to enable that option.

Let me just say that so far I’m pleasantly surprised. My ears are on the small side and fit in the openings of the ear covers so the cushioning doesn’t push down like I saw many people saying happened. I will update if that turns out different over time. It charges very fast and the battery hasn’t moved despite my turning it on and off several times. My AirPod pros 2 aren’t even that good on battery life. Again I’ll update if that changes. I didn’t notice a terrible quality of sound even without the app. I did change it around in app and found everything easy- from the color being the beautiful light gray being when pictured, to the speed it connects with my phone when it turns on. It doesn’t sound tinny or overly sharp or low. I know what I want in a headphone and I’m not disappointed. There was a lot of people saying they had lag when watching YouTube- not a problem for me. The noise cancellation is on par with my AirPod pros 2. Doesn’t totally drown out every little sound but it’s enough to keep my being overwhelmed by noise when doing school work (I have adhd). All around I’m happy with the quality, color, sound, fit, just everything. And trust me when I say I’m picky af with headphones.

B0CRTR3PMF,belowi,the United States,2025-07-30,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent earbuds and a great value,"Purchased these to replace older P3i earbuds that had started to have volume issues after a few years (stuck driver?).  For the money you are getting a great set of noise cancelling earbuds with these P30i’s. These are a slightly different form factor than the older ones but are approximately the same overall size.  Instead of physical buttons these respond to taps to change volume, skip tracks or change noise cancellation mode and this function works quite well and intuitively. The case is a little bigger than the P3i or Airpod cases but is really easy to use with the buds magnetically snapping into the case to charge. The sound quality is very good and I have used the various noise cancellation modes with good results.  In both cases these outperform the P3i. Active noise cancellation in airports and planes (or when someone has the TV on in the house and you need to focus) is quite effective at reducing or canceling almost all external sound, while transparent mode when walking on streets gives you awareness of your surroundings.  Connection with my iphone is consistent and stable. There are several different modes of active noise cancellation you can tweak to try to get the best results for your environment using the app on your phone as well as customizing the actions for the taps on the earbuds. So far both the earbuds and case have survived accidental falls and drops without any problems. Like all in ear buds how tightly pushed in the are has a big impact on how effective the noise cancellation works.",True,0

B0CRTR3PMF,D. Hansberry,the United States,2025-07-30,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 starsDecent Enough, But Not the Best at this Price Point","Let me just start off by saying that they are well worth the $30 I paid for them on sale. Full price of $80 I would give it 3 stars. The sound quality is pretty decent if you're listening in a quiet space. Noise cancellation is not great though for loud noises and makes it even sharper if it's on. I work in a factory making signs and it is good enough most of the time, but when it doesn't, it's even worse than without, also it's pretty bad in wind even just a light breeze.  I don't notice any adapting to environment going on.  Active aware works well enough, but again, not with things like wind. It is a bit weak and on the quiet side for being fully pass though. The battery last a good while, I use them about 6 hours a day and it lasts me about a week on a charge. That said, there is no real way to know how much charge is left in the case without guessing based on when you last charged it. It just has a single light that turns on during charging and when you put the earbuds back in the case. The touch buttons work well, and never have failed to respond, unfortunately you cannot use them to adjust volume. The bluetooth is not the best, seems weaker than other earbuds I've had in the same price range, good enough as long as you're in the same room as your transmitter, but once you leave even just to the other side of a wall it gets pretty spotty. The build quality of the earbuds themselves seems great, I've dropped them numerous times and they still work good as new, and fit quite well, I like their small size. Overall I think their well worth the discounted price, and had I paid the higher price I would not have returned them, but I would likely end up (and still will) with a different brand around the same price point. They are still plenty good for chill music time in a less noisy place though, and I'll keep them around.",True,0

B0CRTR3PMF,Todd S.,the United States,2025-07-30,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsBelow average earbuds,"After owning this for several months and trying different brand of earbuds at different price ranges, I have to say these are not horrible at THIS price range. However, you do get what you pay for. The good: They work, charge fast, and have a decent battery capacity. The bad: sound quality is mediocre. There is no way to change call controls, only media/music controls. The low battery notification seems to be buggy and will give the sound notification that the earbuds have died while it will still have decent battery life. The sound quality is below average. The transparency mode on these are horrible, when you have tried better quality ear buds you almost feel like you aren't wearing anything, but with these earbuds it's like you are trying to hear outside sound through a muffled pillow. This is important when I'm on a call with someone and also need to hear sounds around me when I'm out. So in conclusion, these work, aren't horrible for the money, but for overall quality compared to other ear buds, they're pretty low ranked.",True,0

B0CRTR3PMF,Kyle,the United States,2025-07-28,3.0,"3.0 out of 5 starsGreat isolation, ok sound quality, too much lag","I bought these on sale for about 25 bucks, and for that price, they mostly get the job done! They come with 3 different ear pieces, so it’s easy to get a good seal and block out surrounding noise. I find that I rarely use the noise-canceling feature, though it’s helpful sometimes if I’m sitting in the office and want just a bit of extra quiet. The sound quality is pretty lacking. Though I guess it’s fitting for a set of cheap ear buds. The midrange actually sound a bit distorted, and the only thing that seems to help is using a custom EQ with 3-4dB of cuts in the 1K-4K range. Another issue is the lag between my MacBook Pro (2019) and the headphones. My old AirPods have near zero lag, but these are noticeably behind, meaning that I can’t use them to edit audio/video, which I was hoping to do with them.  None of the recommended tips and tricks from the manufacturer work, so it is what it is. I’ve used these while walking/exercising, and they’re good for those uses, as they seal well and most probably won’t have the same issue with sound quality that I have. These do have a place in my bag, but I can’t quite use them for everything I’d like.",True,0

Just make sure to download the Soundcore app, since you can make these sound way better with some EQ tweaking, and by updating them. Also make sure to enable the '3d surround sound' option, it makes a world of difference. I'd say its a no-brainer, they're so cheap, just go ahead and buy them, the price to performance ratio is insane, I have no complains about these earbuds.",True,0

The functionality of these is great and you can personalize how you want the buds to work. Fit is really good - I have small ears and these fit great. I do still find if I wear them for a long time my ears get sore - but I haven't found a set of earbuds that doesn't do this in some capacity with my small ears, but these are the least fatiguing. Charge holds pretty good, but I do find that I need to re-charge them within an 8 hour period. Also the connectivity is a bit wonky at times. I can connect to two devices, but sometimes it won't work on my phone if connected to my computer and sound is first heard through the headphones from my computer it won't play sound from my phone.

I loved them so much I wanted an identical pair. So I ordered them, when they went on sale for $15!  I received them, paired them but  the volume seemed different. I emailed the Company and ask for trouble shooting ideas. They emailed me back within 10 hours. I was so impressed with this. They gave me ideas I tried each and then waited to see if my ears needed to adjust.  The design is stellar. They are comfortable beyond measure. They fit in and around my ear perfectly. They are lightweight, easy to use and awesome value for your money. Moving forward I responded to their email about the trouble shooting not making much of a difference in the volume. Now, I need you to know that I can hear out of them, it's just different. They emailed me  again within 10 hours, apologizing and asking me if I would like a full refund, or a second option of them sending me a new pair free of charge. I of course asked if I could get a replacement, and  asked them how to return the pair I have now back to them.  The Company responded that you don't have to return them at all!  They also informed me, that they had already mailed me a new pair, and to let them know how the new pair works out. I gotta say I'm so impressed with this company for standing behind their product, customer service and another human being caring about my experience is invaluable. I will always buy my ear buds from them. Oh and BTW, I have 2 pairs of brand new Apple Air that I hate! These blow them out of the water. The Apple Air can sit in the drawer. Thank you so much for reading this. I will update on the new pair. Also, don't be so quick to anger when things don't work for whatever reason. Try to work with these business and contact them to see if they can resolve the issue before reviewing products. We are all human and to be human is to err.... UPDATE: I received the replacement pair yesterday and they were perfect!  I emailed the company last night to let them know that everything was great. I woke up this morning to an email thanking me for my patience and kindness? It was the company and that customer representative , who was kind, patient and attentive. If you are thinking about these ear buds, rest assure this company stands behind their product and will have your back until you the customer is satisfied. 10 Stars all the way....",True,0

M.,the United States,2025-07-27,1.0,1.0 out of 5 starsOn/off switch seems defective and Bass deficient,"I previously had a set of wireless earphones made by Mpow that looked almost identical to these, and I used them for six years. I really liked them. When the ear hook finally broke, I started looking for a similar replacement—specifically with ear hooks and a wire connecting both earpieces. That’s why I chose these Boean headphones, but unfortunately, I’ve run into a few issues. First, turning them on and off is surprisingly difficult. I have to press the button very hard to get it to respond and I’m concerned that repeated use might wear out or damage the switch over time. Another odd thing: the headphones turned on by themselves even after I shut them off. (which could drain the battery unnecessarily) As for the sound quality, the bass is almost nonexistent. What little bass there is sounds distorted, even at low to medium volume levels. But I did notice other reviews mentioning weak or distorted bass, so I am not the only one .experiencing this. Overall, I’m disappointed. I’m not sure if I received a defective pair or if this is just how they’re made.",False,0

B09KGLRF8J,Amanda,the United States,2025-07-11,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat headphones for working out.,"Great headphones for working out. They are solid secure fit, with easy to manage controls. It comes with a convenient case and clip for travel, and a spare set of ear tips. The charge cord is short but it's standard USB-C so any compatible cord will do. The connecting wire between the two earbuds is a decent length, and while I don't find it annoying on my neck, I can easily tuck it into my ponytail or bun hair tie. I've done fairly rigorous workouts with these and have had no problems with them coming out at all - but you do need to ensure you fit them snugly in the ear. For the price, these are solid quality and the sound is good, blocking out most other sound nicely. It connects easily and seamlessly with my iphone and there's been no issues maintaining connection. I haven't worn out the charge yet, it seems to last a decent amount of time. For a cheap pair of earbuds, these are totally worth the price.",True,4

Design & Comfort: First off, the rose gold and white design is sleek and modern—definitely one of the more stylish options out there without breaking the bank. The ear cushions are super soft and comfortable even after a couple hours of wear. The headband has a nice amount of padding too, which adds to the comfort. Sound Quality: For casual listening, the sound quality is surprisingly good. It has a clean, balanced sound with decent bass, especially for music and podcasts. Don’t expect audiophile-level detail, but for day-to-day use—YouTube, Zoom calls, Spotify, etc.—it does more than enough. Volume gets plenty loud without distortion. Bluetooth & Battery: Pairing is quick and easy, and the Bluetooth connection stays stable. Battery life has been solid—I can get through multiple days of use on a single charge, depending on how long I’m using them each day. Charging is also fast, which is convenient when you’re in a rush. Extras & Features: It also has built-in controls on the ear, which are responsive and convenient for skipping tracks, adjusting volume, or answering calls. The microphone is decent enough for calls, though nothing fancy. Final Thoughts: If you’re looking for a budget-friendly pair of wireless headphones that are comfortable, cute, and reliable, these Glynzak headphones are a great buy. Perfect for students, casual users, or anyone who wants a stylish pair without spending a fortune.",True,0

The worst problem I've had is a slight crack in the plastic of the band- but the headphones have held great despite it- and I didn't even notice the crack for some time.

I've had them for a few months now after throwing in the towel on my expensive Beats ear pods that just wouldn't stay in my ears. These were affordable, had decent reviews, and I love a rose gold situation. Let me tell you, these babies hold a charge for a LONG time. The last time I charged them was 2 weeks ago, and I use them at least 10 hours per week. They also cancel out quite a bit of noise. I can barely hear anything external when I'm using them, and even if there's no sound coming out, I have to take them off to hear what people are saying. My 6 y.o. kid uses them sometimes and there were a few times I thought he was going to snap them in half, but alas, they are going strong. So they're clearly quite durable. Lastly, I love that they can connect to two devices at once, so I can hear my phone or laptop without switching connections.",True,8

B0BG28NB7S,Jaimell Torres Gonzalez,the United States,2025-07-25,1.0,1.0 out of 5 starsNo compre estos audífonos. No sirven,"No entiendo de donde y cual es la razón de tantas opiniones. Este dispositivo no sirve. Es una porquería. Llevo una semana usándolo y verdaderamente lo voy a devolver. Verdad que lo barato sale caro. Empezando que al momento de emparejarlo con tu IPhone, por ejemplo, se conecta. Al recibir una llamada, se desconecta, se vuelve a conectar, se vuelve a desconectar, se vuelve a conectar. Y así hasta que tienes que colgar la llamada. Es un chiste. Continuando por la batería. Necesitas 2 horas para cargarlos. Imagínese que soy truck driver y siempre hablo por teléfono, estar por 2 horas con el teléfono en la mano hablando y manejando al mismo tiempo. No funciona. Los AirPods solamente con 30min cargan al 100%. Continuando que se escuchan muy bajito. Un poco más y para poder escuchar bien a otras personas en una llamada me lo meto en los oídos para adentro. Increíble. Para mí, personalmente no sirven. Vale más la pena gastar en unos AirPods y problema resuelto. Créanme. No lo compren. No lo recomiendo.",True,0

The smallest earpiece works for me and I've had no issues so far today while using it.  Glad they give you the extra sizes.  I would highly recommend this if it's what your looking for.

I originally ordered these 27 months ago and they have held up great, until today sadly. They were at 100% battery and kept disconnecting and reconnecting so I knew their time was up. I was glad to see that they were still an option to buy because they are exactly what I need for my personal use, so I ordered another pair. I don't use them a ton, but when I do use them it's for days that I'm treadmill walking, or on my half hour work breaks when I'm eating alone. I'll also wear them at home occasionally when my family is around and I don't want to disturb them with what I'm listening to. They did make it through the warranty, though, even with my sort of lighter than average usage, so I'm happy about the value. I definitely want to continue to come back to this style and brand in the future so I hope they will continue to be produced!",True,0

B09CYL1C2X,NCDad,the United States,2025-03-14,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsVery Good Headphones Just Not For My Personal Day to Day Work Environment,"PROs:  Bluetooth headphones work well.  Well priced.  They have good sound quality.  Several interchangeable ear bud covers for individual ear comfort.  The controls are easy to feel.  The headphones charge quickly. CONs:  However, as one who works outside nearly all day, I found the cord to be cumbersome to deal with throughout the day.  The seatbelt will press against cord, making it taught, and pulls ear piece out when turning head to look over either shoulder.  Also, when carrying items with sling type attachment, the ear piece can get knocked out as sling goes up and over.  Also, if one side is not in my ear, the dangling earpiece will get caught up in my clothing, again creating tension on the cord, when in turns pulls on the earpiece in my ear. Also, the included charging cable is extremely short, less than ~4IN.  It's not long enough for anything useful in my opinion. NOTE:  Headphones were not used in an athletic environment.

I like that they came charged and ready for use, but it is reccommended by the manufacturer to fully charge them, which takes 2 hours, before the first use.  I tried the rubber earpieces that they came equipped with, the X-large I think, and then decided to switch to the smallest set that came with them, the smaller ones, at least for me, are the most comfortable to use so far. I haven't answered any phonecalls with them yet, so I don't know how easy/hard that will be.

Details follow... *Fit is very comfortable. *Ear pads are very soft. *Design is pretty cool but basic. *Touch is only on the outside of the right side, which is good and bad in my opinion. *Connected easily -booklet explains the process WITH the title to look for to connect to. *Battery seems like it may run down at a regular/reasonable pace, not sure, sorry. *Sound is not mind blowing but they are pretty loud. Downfall is that the sound DOES in fact leak A LOT. *EQ options are only alright. There are only three different EQs and they aren't too different. (This is the reason I may return them- not sure yet, but probable.) *Did not come with case. (Not sure but I think it was supposed to come with one.) *Storage isn't TINY of course, but if you have one side up all the way up and the other pulled down a bit, it seems to close/fold down better. *Booklet opens up quit a bit AND has the instructions in MULTIPLE languages. *Price is a tad too high for the quality.. It all comes down to the point that... they're alright but do some shopping around because I'm SURE there is probably a better pair on here lol Happy Shopping! ***Edit: definitely going back. I did in fact find a better pair with much better sound, ANC, for CHEAPER...  Dropped to 2 stars. **NOTE** ALWAYS READ THE ENTIRE PAGE FOR FURTHER DETAILS!!!

This checked all those boxes. It's not active noise cancelling, but noise isolation instead, so it won't have the same effects, but helps with drowning out noise. Size is bearable. I bought a case with it that can hold the aux cord, but otherwise I usually just wear it around my neck and it's pretty lightweight. Due to the light weight, it sits comfortable enough and doesn't weigh too much on the top of my head. I haven't tried the mic for calls yet, so can't speak too much on the quality.",True,0

The sound quality was a bit hollow and wasn't as deep or full as the pair it was going to replace. I acquired these to replace another pair I've had for two years that is starting to run through the battery more quickly. I thought I would try a different brand this time, as I hadn't strayed from another brand for years. The lack of noise cancelling was supposed to be covered by the design. It was pretty good at keeping ambient noise out, but I would not call it comparable to ANC. I ended up giving these to my young daughter to use.

El sonido se podría mejorar, hay una aplicación que te puedes descargar y ajustar el ecualizador sin embargo por más que se ajuste tienen un ligero sonido como a estar ""dentro de un hueco"" y eso al menos a mí no me gusta. Otro punto es que la gente a tu alrededor escucha todo, sobre todo si estás escuchando música con volumen alto y eso es incómodo. Las almohadillas de las orejas al rato de andarlo puestos generan mucho calor y suele incomodar un poco... yo los uso poco, pero creo que si alguien los pretende comprar para darles un uso continuo creo que son factores a tomar en consideración.

Cons: • As an iPhone and Apple device user, the earbuds do not seamlessly integrate or connect automatically across my devices, which can be inconvenient. • Due to the shape of my ears and frequent smiling, the earbuds tend to loosen and eventually fall out. • To monitor battery levels, the Samsung app is required, which adds an extra step for users outside the Samsung ecosystem.

B0CF7GYNW2,Michael M.,the United States,2025-07-22,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Product,"I loved my old 1st gen Amazon Echo Buds, mainly because they fit great. The left side bud would die randomly, and a replacement was over $60 just for the one bud which was more than I spent for them when I bought them, so it was time to move on. I tried multiple other brands since then, and none would fit very good. I found a set that I liked, but they were small, and when I moved my head too much or too fast or if I was sweating at all, they would not stay in. Not sure if my ears are shaped weird or what, but I needed to find buds that came with wingtips. I was between these and JBL, chose these because they cost less at the time. No regrets at all. The wingtips provide a nice secure fit. The ear tips fit decent, although I guess I have large ear holes and the largest tips are still not QUITE big enough for optimal audio. I have some leftover tips from previous brands that fit, but they do not allow the charging case to close, and I don't want to have to take them off each time. Sound quality is great. Touch controls are good and some are customizable through the Samsung Wearable app. The active noise cancelling/ambient noise is pretty good, but not quite as good as the Echo buds were because those used Bose ANC technology. They connect quickly and effortlessly, even pairing them was a breeze. Overall, great product and would highly recommend. Glad I finally found buds that stay in my ears!",True,1

B0CF7GYNW2,AP,the United States,2025-07-21,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsThe only in-ear headphones with perfect fit,"I have an unusual ear. I have purchased four headphones (Dime 3, Beats Solo Buds, Anker Soundcore P40i, and these Samsung Galaxy Buds FE), and this is the only one that fits my ear, even through intense workouts and when chewing or eating food or talking. The wingtips help significantly with stability, and the headphones are not clunky. They are not heavy. I also bought Spinfit custom eartips (Omni) to improve the fit / sound, which I recommend. The sound frequencies are really great and accurate. Bass is only slightly boosted. The active noise cancelling (ANC) seems selective. It blocks out lower frequencies but seems to ignore higher frequencies. Maybe this is so you can still hear voices, but things like wind or rumbling are muted. The touch control buttons are simple but not too sensitive; play, previous track, change ANC, etc. The headphones automatically pair when removing them from the charging case. The battery is pretty average. At medium volume with ANC on, it will last most of the work day, so you still need to briefly charge it in the middle of the day. Connectivity range is pretty average. If you move to an adjacent room, the connection should be stable, but even farther will likely have connectivity issues. There is an app you can install, but it is only available for Android or windows. If you only have iOS or Apple products, you're out of luck. You don't need the app to use the headphones though, just if you want change equalizer sound presets or customize touch controls.",True,0

None measures up to the Pro 2 (the only one that are even a tad better are the apple's buds, but those aren't cheap). So I managed to get a pair of these fe buds on black Friday on an excellent deal of about $54. I am glad I did. The fe buds are very close in sound quality to the Pro 2. The bass is rich but not overwhelming, noise cancelation is as good, and honestly the case is nice (I don't know what other negative reviews of the case are complaining about). Even for $60+ these would be a very good purchase (don't waste your time and money on el-cheapo buds - put that money towards the fe buds, you won't regret it).",True,1

The sound quality is surprisingly good—bass is punchy without drowning out vocals, and everything sounds clear whether I’m listening to music or taking calls. The active noise cancellation works well, especially in places like buses or coffee shops, and the earbuds fit securely thanks to the wingtip design, which I find more comfortable than other models I’ve tried. Battery life easily lasts me through the day, and I usually get around 5 to 6 hours per charge with ANC on, plus extra from the case. I do wish it had wireless charging and better water resistance, and the touch controls can be a little finicky at times. Also, the mic quality is just okay—it gets the job done but isn’t great in loud environments. Still, for under $100, I think these earbuds are a great value, especially if you’re already using a Samsung phone since they integrate really well with Galaxy features like Auto Switch and SmartThings Find.",True,11

Outside of the shower and in bed, I wear them basically constantly. CONSTANTLY. I can do that bc they're super light and comfy. SO, not super surprising when the plastic by the earpiece where it meets the neck strap cracked in Feb 2025.  I reached out to the company, and they refunded me. Huge plus. The unit continued to work however, until now in June -- the neckstrap itself has cracked and only one side is audible. So even though they wear out under heavy usage, I am about to buy again. Worth it for me bc there aren't a lot of other headsets like this, esp with BT 5.0 and USB C charging.  I habitually charge every night but on the occasion I forget, that battery lasts! (Again, heavy usage!) Love that they can connect to multiple sources at once too, and connection is stable, sound is good. Plus I'm from the 20th century lol so I love dedicated buttons for volume up/down, track forward/back, pause/play. All in all, highly recommend!",True,2

I am absolutely blown away by the Soundcore V20i by Anker! These open-ear headphones deliver an unbeatable combination of comfort, sound quality, and functionality. The adjustable ear hooks ensure a snug, ultra-comfortable fit that stays secure no matter how active I am—perfect for workouts, commuting, or just relaxing. The sound quality is phenomenal—crisp, powerful, and immersive, without the discomfort of in-ear buds. Calls are crystal clear, thanks to the advanced mic technology, and the IP55 rating means I don’t have to worry about sweat or light rain. With 36 hours of playtime, I rarely need to charge them, and Bluetooth 5.4 ensures a rock-solid connection. The multipoint connection is a huge plus, allowing me to switch seamlessly between my phone and laptop. Anker has truly outdone itself with the V20i—these are hands-down the best open-ear earbuds I’ve ever used. Highly recommend! 🎧🔥",True,0

B0D2XRXNGY,Nick B,the United States,2025-07-27,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 starsGreat sound, comfortable fit, excellent features -- but with a few minor issues.","PROS: + ""Full"" sounding audio with lots of volume and EQ ranges to hear different parts of music clearly. Doesn't sound tinny or overly compressed like budget headphones often do. For me, they're more than adequate, and punch well above their weight for the price you pay. + Lots of EQ settings in the app to fine-tune the sound to what you want. Wasn't overly impressed with the sound quality at first but with the right settings, they sound great. + Open-ear design allows you to hear your surroundings, doesn't muffle your own voice, and makes the sound feel more ""natural"" without the added pressure of an in-ear fit. + IP55 rating is supposed to be sweat and dust resistant, making these safe to use outdoors and during exercise where those elements might ordinarily cause issues on other devices. + Adjustable ear piece with four click-positions helps to find a preferred position for best sound, and the ear hook stays in place well even during outdoor exercise, so long as nothing directly snags on it to yank it off. + Microphone quality seems to be pretty good for answering calls; haven't had any issues with people struggling to hear me, and when asked they said it sounded fine. + Multi-point connection to two simultaneous devices. It's always paired to my phone, but then I can also connect to my Steam Deck to hear game sound, and it'll switch based on audio input for each device when necessary. + Low-latency ""gaming mode"" eliminates sound delay almost entirely, allowing for a seamless bluetooth gaming experience. + Excellent warranty support. I had an issue with one bud after a drop, and Anker sent a replacement (refurbished, I believe) immediately. + Charging case is relatively compact; I like how slim it is, making it fit into various pockets on my pants or shirt without creating an uncomfortable bulge that strains the fabric. + Battery life seems to be reasonable. Not sure if these would last playing continuous sound at high volume for a full eight hour work day, but I've had them ""on"" for up to 12 hours at time while sporadically listening to podcasts for hours at a time, and they usually last long enough to get through the day. + Comfortable fit that I can wear all day. I wear glasses, and will often wear a second pair of sun glasses or safety glasses over my prescriptions, and even with all that I don't experience any discomfort around my ears when adding these earbuds to the mix. + Multicolor LED lights on the earbuds that can sync to the music. You can't see them yourself during use unless you look in the mirror, and I prefer them to stay off for better battery and a more incognito look, so to me this is a complete non-factor, but could be a ""pro"" if you care about that. CONS: - Unhelpful charge indicator on the case, and on the buds themselves. On the case, it's a single tiny light that's either solid to show >45%, or blinking to show <45%. It's not the most intuitive thing in the world, and the included manual doesn't even tell you this in the first place; I had to look it up on their website after realizing I had no idea what the light actually meant. It only shows when you put a bud back in, so it might be >45% when you finish using them, then be 15% or whatever by the time it finishes charging the earbuds. I've had times when I've just run out of charge unexpectedly because the light wasn't informative enough, and with it being such a tiny inconspicuous light it takes conscious effort to think to check it so I would sometimes just miss the fact that the case charge was low. The buds themselves also don't show their charge level on the device itself, only in the app -- seems like the colored LED lights could show the charge level with colors so you know what level they're at when you remove them from the case. Would also be nice if the case could have more than one light to show more granular charge levels, and if they were in a more prominent, visible spot. - The touch controls are slightly awkward to use. The earbuds have a very large outer surface area, and yet seemingly only the center portion of it is touch-sensitive, which leads to a lot of missed inputs where I tap slightly off-center and get nothing, or accidentally trigger a single-tap when I was trying to do a double-tap, or accidentally trigger a double-tap when repeatedly missing a single-tap, and other such issues. I use sun hoodies and caped hats to protect my ears and neck when exercising outdoors, and when they start to get soaked with sweat they trigger the touch controls on each earbud. So I often find myself disabling the touch controls altogether, and then have to adjust volume and whatever else on my smart watch or phone. - Potential durability issues with moving parts on the adjustable earpiece. One time recently I was removing my bike helmet and a strap caught on the earpiece, making it fall to the asphalt. Afterward it got stuck in one position and couldn't switch to other positions without a concerning amount of force, which was necessary to put it back in the case and again afterward to get a good fit for my ear. I used silicone grease on the plastic housing hoping to get it moving again, which worked for a while, but then a week later the speaker shorted out and stopped working altogether. Not sure if that was from my lubricant, or delayed damage from the drop, or both. Anker was quick to replace it under warranty, and the warranty itself is generous at 18 months, so it should be good for a while longer, but may mean a more limited lifespan if the moving earpiece is an actual weakspot in the construction. - As an open-ear speaker, it doesn't allow for any noise cancelling or decibel reduction, so these are not ideal to use in all situations where you might want to drown-out unwanted sounds. Not necessarily a ""con"" considering the open-ear is also a ""pro,"" but just something you have to be aware of.",True,1

After couple of hours of calls, left earbud is at 70% and right one at 20% and disconnects? I know right one act as master, that does not mean it will consume several times more battery.  Also, why it shuts down at 20% in middle of calls? I looked to see if there is any option in the app if I can make left as master to get a reference, but I do not see that option. Either this headset I have defective, or all are like that if we use for voice calls. Another negative is, the case designed fit the unit when ear hook is fully closed/retracted position. So everytime I need to expand and put it, and close it and put it back. So it is not one hand operation anymore.

I found these to be extremely comfortable. I love the fact that they can be adjusted to different positions as not everyone has the same size and shape ears! The sound quality is also excellent. These were easily the comfiest between boytond, and haowolf that I tried. Now for the bad…. The button functions are horrible. It’s double tap to play/pause with one of them and then it’s double tap to skip on the other and that’s it! There’s no volume adjustment tapping feature and now previous track feature either. And the lack of functions is fine, it’s just annoying I need to pull out my phone to adjust the volume or go to a previous track if I’m feelin a song. Now for the worst part about these headphones. The case is extremely far behind compared to the cases of the other 2 brands I tried. There is no percentage level on the case so I have noooo idea when the case needs to be recharged. There is also ZERO indication as to what percentage the headphones are at when charging them in the case or if they are at any point fully charged! When I put them in the case there’s a white light that goes on, but only for a second and then it disappears! Unfortunately the case is extremely lacking as is the button functions. But as a mail carrier working 10-12 a day with these around my ears the comfort is the most important to me.

B0D2XRXNGY,Michael L. Lewis,the United States,2025-07-17,4.0,4.0 out of 5 starsComfortable and stay in place,"These are very comfortable and have great battery life. I’ve owned two pairs of these, I lost the first pair on vacation. The open ear buds go around my ears nicely and stay in place when working out or running, I tend to wear them for hours while I work and I really enjoy them. The battery life has been great as well. The reason for 4 stars is that they aren’t great if I get a phone call because the mic doesn’t seem to work well and people have trouble hearing me. Also the bass is almost non existent, but they are still pleasant for music. They are also a good choice for listening to podcasts and audiobooks where bass isn’t a priority, and they are neutral and clear for that purpose. Overall these are very nice for the price and I find they stay in place and are more comfortable than most ear buds.",True,10
B0D2XRXNGY,Rabr,the United States,2025-07-17,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent earphones. Charging box could be better.,"Very impressed! These light weight on the ear “earphones” are excellent. They fit good, lightweight and have an excellent sound quality. I was especially impressed with the app that let you adjust tone quality and bass. I ended up liking the preset tone the best but it is nice to know these can be adjusted if you want too. My only complaint is the charging box. It does not have a decent charge indicator. It is just a light. I have another pair, different brand, that has charge % level indicators for the box and for the ear phones. I really like that BUT those phones do not sound near as good as these. I’ll take the sound quality any day! Highly recommend.",True,1
