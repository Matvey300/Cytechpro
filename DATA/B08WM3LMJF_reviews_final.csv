B08WM3LMJF,Stephen Strong,the United States,2025-07-31,3.0,3.0 out of 5 starsSmaller ears than expecting,I was wanting to order another pair of July bc my other pair had lasted me until my kid broke the ear thing.  It's a good quality headphone just the ear thing barely covers my ears.  Im not sure if this is a kids size or what but its not the same size as my other one.  Im glad I have little ears or I would have shipped them back.  They are to small I the ears for my 15 year old son.

B08WM3LMJF,Roger Lodge,the United States,2025-07-30,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsExceeded my expectations,"I wanted some wireless headphones for exercising. I used to use clip on earphones but have never liked earbuds. I decided to try these larger headphones for a change. They didn't come charged like some devices, but charging didn't take long. The bass response and treble is better than I expected at this price point. The bluetooth connectivity also has good range. I'm not a big bluetooth user, but I have a bluetooth receiver dongle I've used to play audio from my phone into my stereo and it has poor range. However, wearing these headphones I went at least 30 feet away from my phone and they still sounded unaffected by the range.",True,0

B08WM3LMJF,Thheadley,the United States,2025-07-30,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsGreat for budget or for kids,I brought these on October of 2021 and they are still holding up. The ear pads have worn down but for the price and how long they are lasting I can't complain. I will say however that I find myself wanting to turn the volume up but it's already max. I use mainly at the gym. I also sweat on my face which could be why the ears look the way they do. Overall they served me well over the years.,True,0

B08WM3LMJF,Damien,the United States,2025-07-29,2.0,2.0 out of 5 starsHorrible headphones,"These are some of the worst headphones I have ever owned. They are painful on the ears since they do not go over them but on top of them. It's hard to where them for long periods of time. They also continuously stop playing audio despite still being connected. It's not that they are low battery or far away, they just randomly stop playing audio mid video. Then I can't even get them to start playing again unless I continuously turn them off and on and disconnect and reconnect. These are absolutely not worth it.",True,0
B08WM3LMJF,amzical,the United States,2025-07-29,5.0,5.0 out of 5 starsWorks great for sensory overload,"These are not completely noise canceling, but they do enough of a good job that I do not feel overwhelmed on the bus. My flavor of ADHD includes sensory overload, specifically with sound. Just putting in ear plugs on the bus doesn't work because it drowns out most of the background noise, which only makes the noise closer to me that much more stressful. But if I put on these + a soothing anti-anxiety playlist, I'm usually not in a sensory overload/panic attack-type situation. And bonus - headphones work pretty well as a ""Don't talk to me"" measure",True,0

B08WM3LMJF,Pamela Chavez,the United States,2025-07-27,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 starsIncredible Sound, Noise Canceling & Battery Life!","These headphones have completely exceeded my expectations! The noise cancellation is outstanding , it blocks out background sounds even in busy places like cafés or public transport. I can finally enjoy music and podcasts without distractions. The volume is impressively loud and clear, with deep bass and crisp highs. Whether I'm listening to relaxing music or working out, the sound quality stays top notch. What I love the most is the battery life. I’ve been using them daily and only need to charge them once every few days , they easily last over 30 hours on a single charge. Plus, the fast-charging feature is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. They're also super comfortable and don’t cause ear fatigue, even after long use.",True,0

The volume control is pretty loud, I love my headphones being loud. Next is the compatibility. So basically it’s good. It’s just that I HATE IT when the foam on the headphones fall off.

B08WM3LMJF,Late,the United States,2025-07-24,1.0,1.0 out of 5 starsBe aware,"I did not buy from Amazon, but I wanted to write a review so that others may be aware. At first I immediately purchased because they were JBL’s and knew they would be great or so I thought. These lasted maybe two months if that. I only wore for an hour per day for workout sessions. Pros: sound quality was excellent! Which is why I bought to begin with. Cons: not a massive deal breaker, but the battery life was mediocre. I’ve had better. The cushion on the headphones fell off immediately and won’t stay on the originally when purchased. For the price point and JBL I’d expect better. The headphones seemed pretty cheap too. I did not have them long at all to enjoy any other features. HIGHLY disappointed with these headphones. The reason I purchased was because my headphones of 20 years the battery life lasted FOREVER and I do mean FOREVER!! The cushion fell off and the muffs were flaking off. I definitely miss the quality of those headphones and the longevity. Very very disappointed with these headphones. Now I will have to purchase new ones yet again.

When I go to try to use them the battery is drained. Again, I hardly use and I charge them when I attempt to use them and notice the battery is drained. If I don’t use them much, shouldn’t it still be charged the next time I try to use them? When I have used them, it’s literally been around 10 minutes. I was going to return them but my return window has closed. Do not recommend.",True,0
