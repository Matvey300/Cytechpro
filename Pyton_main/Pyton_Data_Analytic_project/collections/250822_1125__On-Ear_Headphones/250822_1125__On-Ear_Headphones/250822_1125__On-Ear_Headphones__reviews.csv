Best value and comfort for Web meetings",5.0,The Gadgetman,2025-06-22,"As someone who spends throughout the day in Web meetings, a comfortable and long lasting headphone is a must.  I've tried many, including earbuds and have come to appreciate this one. What I like:- Comfort:  When you sometimes spends hours in Web meetings, on-ear headphones becomes really painful.  Over-the-ear also shuts out outside sounds better than on-ear.- Wired: I don't have to worry about running out of charge like earbuds and wireless headphones.  The sound quality is also guaranteed to be consistent over wireless.- Inexpensive:  At this price-point, I can easily buy another one if it gets broken (usually from me stepping on them).- Sound quality: The meeting participants couldn't really differentiate the sound quality with likes of Bose.  NOTE: The results may be different when using for other than Web meetings where sound quality is critical.- 3.5mm Jack:  This is the gold standard for sound.  I've had USB-based headphones and had issues with the USB-driver. Fortunately, all 4 laptops I own (3 Lenovo Windows & Macbook Air M2) have 3.5mm port.- Brand:  Panasonic is not a fly-by-night and they're known to product quality products.",the United States,True,10,RF5HWXSGR399C

Fantastic for the price",5.0,Alex,2025-05-10,"To preface I bought these with my own money and am not sponsored in anyway, I’m just an audio nerd. These are almost exactly the same as the model that came with my mom’s cd player from the mid 80s. Only difference is the color and the ear pads hadn’t disintegrated. They sound the exact same too, which is to say surprisingly good. Mids and highs are clear, bass isn’t muddled and has good thump to it. They’re super light and comfortable. Cable is nice and has no noise from it so it has great insulation on it. Not much sound isolation but that’s kinda expected from on ear headphones. All around solid headphones and huge bang for your buck.",the United States,True,0,R2ATQKMU58HUPL

Sounds amazing! But jack is too thick with phone case without modifying!",5.0,BM,2025-04-23,"The sound from this RP-HT21M blows my mind! I did not know these videos I'm watching have bass like this in them also high frequency clarity is crisp. Two things surprised me though. First is the 90 degree connection! May end up liking it but I expected a straight jack. Second! The jack will NOT fit your phone with a case on it! Too thick to be able to plug it in! Took a razor blade and cut a ring about 2mm off the black rubber around the jack and then grinded it carefully with a rotary tool for good measure to reduce the diameter to fit the hole in my phone case. ( as others show in reviews doing similar fix )I like the slim design you can lean back in bed against the pillow and it is not pushing on the headphones! Have not tried the microphone yet but I'm sure it will be ok! Again! Sounds amazing!!!

Great Sound but with some issues",2.0,North Woods,2025-09-06,"These Sony headphones sound incredible, and they fit snug for immersive listening. However, that's where the positives end for me.The user experience is hampered by several design choices. The small power button is fiddly and difficult to locate by touch. The Bluetooth pairing function is integrated with the power button, meaning that holding it for slightly too long to initiate pairing can accidentally power the headphones off entirely, which is quite frustrating. Charging is also a step backward in modern convenience. While the headphones do feature a USB-C charging port, Sony bafflingly included a low-voltage, slow-charging USB-A to USB-C cable, instead of a modern USB-C to USB-C cable that would allow for faster charging and utilize current power bricks. They included a short, 6-inch cable which would not allow enough reach to charge while listening and multitasking on the phone.Crucially, these headphones have significant compatibility issues, even after extensive troubleshooting (I've tried all possible resets and re-pairings). While they work fine for basic audio playback from my Android phone, they consistently fail to connect to other devices like my iPad or TV, severely limiting their versatility. Most importantly for my needs, they are not compatible with my DJI Mic receiver for live audio monitoring during recording; they only work for audio playback after a recording is complete. This makes them unusable for my workflow.Despite their genuinely great sound, I cannot recommend these headphones if you need multi-device functionality, live audio monitoring capabilities, or expect the fast charging and modern conveniences that come with USB-C. They are simply too limited for anything beyond basic audio playback on a single device.",the United States,True,0,RCO5L2TJWSSA4

Great sound quality",4.0,kelly dyer,2025-08-23,"Sound quality is amazing! Compared to my Samsung buds, jlab and a couple of others I've purchased, none of them has come close to these. They fit great and don't hurt my head or ears after wearing them for long periods of time. I love that I can blast my worship music while still hearing my daughter and not annoy anyone around me with the music being loud outside of the headphones. The only negatives are not coming with a bag or case to store them in while not in use and the charging cord that came with the box doesn't belong to the headphones.

Absolutely in love with these headphones. I bought these for the gym because AirPods don’t stay in when I work out but these stay on great. The battery life is amazing I’ve only had to charge these twice since I’ve had them which has been for a couple of months now. I do only use it to work out so I can’t speak to how the charge is for full day use. Sound is great and it lets me know what the battery percentage is as soon as I connect.

Big Sound, Short Comfort Window",3.0,Sunny R,2025-08-20,"The Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Headphones deliver impressively clear sound and marathon battery life at a budget-friendly price. Lightweight and stylish, they’re a solid pick for casual listening. However, Bluetooth can be temperamental, slow to pair and occasionally prone to dropouts. Comfort is another trade-off: the on-ear design feels tight over time, especially for kids, making long listening sessions less than ideal.Basically, they sound great and last forever but for all-day wear or seamless connectivity, they fall a bit short.",the United States,True,1,RZWBDKJ3UMIRE

Long lasting headphones with amazing battery life and sound.",5.0,Rose,2025-08-20,"Had these headphones for 5-6 years until I had accidentally sat on them, causing one of the muffs to snap off. And even then, the headphones still worked! I just had to buy another pair because I couldn’t glue the muff back to the headband. But honestly, these headphones are so durable. They’re a steal given its amazing quality.Durability: You don’t need to store them in any headphones case. You can put it in your purse, backpack, or bag leave them lying anywhere without worrying about them breaking. Coming from someone who uses these headphones all the time and as a to go for my workouts, and even wearing them on rainy days. Exposure to sweat and moisture in general never affected its sound quality at all! They’re super comfortable and light to wear and I find them so much better than $100-$300+ headphones.Comfort/Battery life: You can wear them for hours comfortably. I only needed to charge them once or twice every two weeks, and I use them for 4-5 hours daily. You only need to charge them for like 15-20 minutes and you’re good to go. They last FOREVER.Design: I love that they’re light weight and simple, making them really comfortable to wear. Personal preference but prefer lighter/simple headphones designs than chunky headphones.Sound: Even though they’re not noise cancelling they pack powerful sound and pretty good bass. You can listen on full volume without worrying about damaging them.Had to write a review bc these headphones are a gem. You should absolutely buy these if you’re looking for high quality and long lasting headphones on a tight budget.",the United States,True,34,R2H0PUOTWSL0K1

Great sounding cheap headphones. Bass cracks a bit",4.0,syd,2025-08-23,"I bought these because they’re Sony and they’re cheap. I was immediately impressed with the quality materials used, not cheap brittle plastic and really good cables. They fit my huge head pretty well and I really like the cups rotating flat for storage. I might buy another pair for backup though I think these will be plenty durable. The sound quality is freaking impressive at all audio levels! Nice and clear. I’m hearing elements in my old music that I never noticed before, tracks mixed in that were too muddy for my ears to pick out before. Even though these things probably shouldn’t be able to knock out the lower bass tones, it does very well though if I really push it at higher volume for an extended period, the bass will start to crackle a little bit. It could be my cheap Pyle amp. It’s not really supposed to drive 24 ohm headphones.  Anyway, way to go Sony!",the United States,True,0,R16FY0XFEMC423

Thank You Sony for Making TV Listening So Enjoyable",5.0,Pamela H.,2025-08-10,"I have a very very old smart tv with really bad sound quality, and these headphones have improved my listening experience immensely, particularly when watching shows with a lot of music content. I live in an apartment with thin walls, use the headphones all of the time so I don't have to crank up the volume on the tv. They are lightweight and comfortable and amazingly inexpensive for the sound quality. I have bought a few sets over the last 6 years. With daily use, the cushioning around the ears has fallen apart on a couple pairs and the connection on another pair stopped working after a year or so. Thank you Sony for making good, affordable headphones.P.S. They are not noise cancelling, and I use wireless Sennheiser earbuds when I'm  listening to music on my phone.

Uncomfy...",2.0,Bee,2025-07-24,"I tried really hard to like these since I also own & like the JLab Lux ANC over ears, but they get uncomfortable after listening for over an hour 😭 I have average sized ears and they go over my ear just fine, but I'm not sure if it's how tight these headphones are but that + the muffs just make my ears hurt after having them on after the first few minutes. It's a bummer because they sound great (close to the over ears counterpart), and I know other folks have said they're comfy so maybe it's just a me thing.

Good Sounding Headphones Limited by Their On-Ear Form factor",4.0,Severian,2025-06-17,"Pros:* Comfortable* Well built* Battery length estimate from mfgr is accurate* Excellent app* Sound quality is well balanced, no dominant EQ range over any other* Controls are well placed and reliably functioning.CONS:* On ear headphones do not provide optimal noise cancellation. These are certainly better than nothing, but nowhere near as good as headphones with over ear cushions, like Jlabs own JLabs Lux (without the ""GO"" designation).* On ear headphones also do not seal the sound is as well as over ears, so if you like really deep bass, you are not going to find it here.* The headphone frame is a bit small, for my large hat sized head. I need to ratchet the arms out to maximum extension and even then, the fit is not optimal.Bottom Line:Some people don't like headphone cushions that cover the entire ear, due to the perception that such designs are hot and / or uncomfortable. If you are one of those folks - and you have a small or medium sized head - these are an excellent choice. The sound is well tuned, the app is really useful, the NC is adequate for medium demand use (subway OK, plane less so), and the headphones were built with excellent quality control. I would especially praise JLAB for not smothering the sound profile with sludgy inaccurate bass, a common failure with inexpensive / small brand headphones. These were tuned by someone that knows accurate sound and cares about providing such to a customer.If you want better sound, better NC, and have a bigger head (and don't mind over ear designs) you should spend a few dollars more and get the ""non-GO"" version of the JLab Lux, their over ear fitting model.",the United States,False,1,R2K1YD7XFF3A5Y

Comfortable Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones",5.0,Hmo,2025-05-29,"Pairing this with my child’s MP3 player was seamless and very easy. She was giggling with how quickly we got that part figured out. The sound is extremely clear and not muffled. They definitely have the noise-cancelling feature that makes listening in a busy household so much more enjoyable. She really likes the texture and feeling of the ear pads– it is a soft foam with a kind of fabric over the top that is similar to a silky faux leather. I tried them on and agreed they are incredibly comfy on the ears. I wear glasses so that is a big deal with headphones pushing against my ears. The top of the headphones does sit kind of heavy on the top of my head, however. That might just be because I have a big head? It doesn’t bother my daughter at all.  But the ear comfort is fantastic for both of us. The headphones also don’t leak sound like some others we have– so when my daughter is jamming out, I don’t have to hear it!",the United States,False,0,RLZLL6OBMIOD8

Not the best for working out, but sound good",4.0,Dani,2025-05-02,"-Look great.  Very minimal and sleek. Matte mauve color is unique and stylish.-Comfy and pretty lightweight as far as over ear headphones go.  I am used to using in-ear headphones, so the over the ear versions are inherently heavier. I find that I can only wear these for a few hours before needing a break, but don't know that that would be different for any over ear versions. These have great padding on the ears.  I have a very big head so they have to stretch a bit, but fit well. I do find that they get a bit hot if using for a long time.-Sound good. Good base.  You lose a little something on the high notes/upper registers.  They can sound a bit tinny, not as round, but not bad, and that seems to be the case for all but the most expensive earphones. Overall I think they sound great.-The noise canceling feature works pretty well. You can still hear the world around you but it is muffled. I do find that I feel like I am in a tunnel with them on.  Feel like I can hear my own heartbeat in my head.  So took a little getting used to. Again, I don't like to use them like this for more than a few hours at a time.-Not my favorite for working out.  They tend to slip down into your face if you bend forward.  So I find that I am constantly readjusting them if I wear them while doing something very active.  Maybe this is just a fit issue for me? Not sure. These are best suited to seated work, light walking, or housework.",the United States,False,0,R14ARPNWFAY9E

Excellent default sound signature. Comfortable on ear headband. Every feature I can think of.",5.0,lvron,2025-04-16,"JLab is a well-known brand for making excellent products. The Go Lux Headband is another one of those excellent products. I am not a fan of the ear covering headbands (I refer to them as earmuff headsets) unless needed for extreme noise cancelling. The go Lux headband does not completely cover the ear but rests upon it with a soft rubber-like, foam filled covering. These are very comfortable without contributing to the ""ear-claustrophobia"" (my made-up word) syndrome. My most used headsets are over-ear air conduction types. When I want to listen to Bass-forward music I'll use in-ear earbuds, and for sports, pool or workouts it's bone conduction. I wanted to try the Go Lux since it has almost every feature that can be offered on a headset and thought it would be comfortable as a sometime replacement for in-ear earbuds - and it is. The default sound signature is great but when in the mood for more Bass the app has a Bass boost pre-select option. For those who need even more Bass, the custom equalizer can do that. ANC works but is only moderately effective based on my testing. Still nice to have it. Spatial sound expands the sound stage. I keep Spatial sound on all the time. The Go Lux can get dangerously loud. The Safe Hearing feature is a must-have with this kind of volume capability. Playtime is rated at 70+ hours. After going through a lengthy period of heavy testing, I fully charged it and left it in the box unused for several weeks. I put them on to write this review and they connected immediately to my phone showing 100% power. Multi-point connections worked as expected. Call quality is very good for both parties. I reported on some of the most important features to me. I'll leave reading the complete list of features to the official product description. Considering the comfort, construction, sound quality and feature set, this is a good value 5-star headset.",the United States,False,0,R3JIPPUIMC9JCK

Sounds Good, Feels Good — For A While",4.0,Elmer Cat,2025-04-13,"These headphones sound pretty good and the 3 modes of noise cancellation can make a big difference.  You can choose to cancel ambient noise, or in the ""be-aware"" mode actually amplify it.  The ear cushions are soft and comfortable, but are made from a non-breathable material which becomes less comfortable after being worn for a while.  The headband can be adjusted, but in its tightest setting still leaves the headphones somewhat loose such that they can slip down or fall off with running, biking, or other exercise. If you're just sitting down they fit good.  The current Amazon listing price of $50 represents a reasonable value for this item.",the United States,False,0,R2M8EZJSN4XURV

Noise reduction, not noise canceling",3.0,Cari,2025-04-13,"The JLab Go Lux ANC Wireless Headphones are supposed to be noise canceling, but that is incorrect. It would be more correct to say noise reduction. I like the padding, but it does get warm after some time. Due to the way my ears are shaped, headphones work better for me than earbuds. I do wear glasses, so finding headphones that are comfortable with extended wear is hard to come by. These headphones are no exception. Maybe they are just too small for my head, but I don't think so. I have used these on a call, and it was a bit of a pain to get them working correctly. Once I did, the call went fine.

They're good, but not great. They are comfortable and seem well built and the button configuration is pretty standard so they're easy to use. The battery life is decent. The connectivity rage is ok. The volume range is just right, so you have room to crank them up a bit for that jam but he bass is lacking. The sound is and balanced, but maybe too balanced so the bass comes off a little weak. The ANC is decent for on ear phones. At this price point I've reviewed lots of lesser known on ear headphones that deliver better bass  a better connection range.

Also the material on the headphones doesn't breathe well; I personally get sweaty on the ears after a while if im active.Also, I've tried everything to troubleshoot, but these do not produce any sound if you're using for phone calls to the other person.

Overall great pair, with some things to be aware of.",4.0,Sidney Tsai,2025-03-27,"I got this JLAB Go Lux ANC in Sage green, and while I think it's a great pair of headphones overall, there are some things to be aware of for its price. For what it is, it's great. The headphones by default are lacking in base, but perform well at midrange to tenor points. The Active noise cancelling is suprisingly impressive for being on-ear headphones. However, the ear cups are completely flat, which results in some difficulty when it comes to staying on your head. The material seems durable, but also hard to replace if broken. The software for android works incredibly seamlessly, and I'm satisfied. The color is difficult to pair with outfits, as the green is a very odd color.

Smooth Sound; Surprisingly Comfortable Fit; ANC Sort Of",4.0,Jackrbike,2025-03-23,"I’ve had these for a bit over a month now, to be sure I would not rely on first impressions.On-Ear vs. Over Ear—Everyone DiffersI use headphones for periods up to three hours at a time, sometimes four.  Inevitably I have felt a degree of discomfort on the ears when I’ve used on-ear headphones.  This discomfort never has been present with over the ear style.  I confess I got these knowing my previous experiences, but I was willing to try again, knowing JBL’s reputation for sound, the fact that ANC is touted for these, and the fact that I am entirely satisfied with a pair of JBL earbuds I do have that do not have ANC.The cushioning for these is very very good, and the on ear pressure from the headband is not bad at all.The sound is surprisingly good, and one can tailor the sound using an equalizer if one wishes.  Bass seemed to get somewhat better over time.  Perhaps that needed a break-in period.  Bass is smooth and certainly is not boomy.  Overall, though 25% of my earphone usage is musical, I’d say JBL did a good job on these headphones, considering the price.Push button control is good.  Sound feed thru for the pass sound through mode is satisfactory though not using that mode is also satisfactory.  However, I did find the ANC to be unimpressive, likely in part because these are, after all, on-ear headphones, which invite sound pass through, either way, by their very nature.  (I have a pair of $40 ear buds with ANC that is so good that I use them on airplanes.)Do I still prefer over-ear headphones?  Absolutely, but they can get warm over time; I can count on these to allow better air circulation when it is needed.  Rotation between types may be in order.",the United States,False,0,R1Q3VNHVK2KYMV

Fantastic customizability",5.0,Catharine M,2025-03-15,"-- Active Noise Cancellation --The ANC works well, but likely would be better with over-ear instead of on-ear cups. With that said, it does perform better than I expected. The intensity is customizable in the app; a fantastic feature especially for sensitive ears. Low ANC blocks some bass noise, while high ANC blocks a significant amount of bass noise, less mids, and minimal highs.-- Passive Noise Cancellation --PNC does not block a lot of sound, which I attribute to the on-ear form factor. The pads are comfortable, but I found that the tips of my ears started to hurt after a little bit.-- Fit and Comfort --As said above, the ear pads are pretty comfortable, but I had minor pain in my ears after a while. This may get better with time. Because these are on-ear, there isn't much holding them in place; I found that they were vulnerable to jostling. Not great for walking around during a commute, and I would be worried about them falling off if I were running to catch a bus. The build does feel nice and solid, though, so I wouldn't be too worried about wear and tear.-- Sound Quality --The sound quality is excellent, with booming bass and defined highs. You can customize the equalizer in the app to suit your taste.-- App --These are the most customizable headphones I've ever owned, and I love it. The ANC/PNC/Awareness cycle can be adjusted, if you wanted to remove awareness mode or ANC from the rotation when pressing the ANC button, for example. There is a good slider-based equalizer with three presets: JLab Signature, Balanced, Bass Boost. I prefer JLab Signature, which is the default. Like the ANC button, the other buttons' controls are customizable. You can set one, two, and three tap actions, and long presses of the volume buttons, and they can be set to switch EQ, last track, next track, volume up/down, noise control, google/siri. There is an option for spatial audio, which creates a cool directional audio effect. There is also a safe hearing mode, but it seems to be a straight volume decrease, not a limiter.",the United States,False,0,R1HIXA7T23QXAA

not great",2.0,Aila Piatkiewicz,2025-09-06,bought 1 and it broke the same year. bought another one because the first one breaking was kind of on me. 2nd one broke within 5 months due to the little swiveling (swivling?) part just snapping. would not recommend if you need to return either because it has to be in the packaging in a different box. lord... anyway I bought a different pair from a different brand and I've had them for 8 months now and no issues so far. plus they're like 30 dollars cheaper than these.,the United States,True,0,R1W64ZKWRNO0R8

Very good for the price",4.0,Reid Family,2025-08-03,"I use these as PC headphones. For podcasts and a little bit of music listening, these are plenty good enough. For the price, you can easily buy several pairs and have backups. The sound quality is okay, but there isn't much bass response which is expected at this price point. I have a large head and these fit snug, but you can bend the plastic headband a bit and that works to get comfortable. The cord length is short, but good for a phone or sitting close to a laptop. It is a bit difficult to see which headphone is Left and Right, but there is an L and R if you look really closely. Be aware, there is no mic or volume button controls.",the United States,True,2,R2RIPHRWFXFWY4

Now we're talking.",5.0,Phantazm,2025-02-09,"Disappointed by my purchase of a similar product from Philips, I figured I'd try Sony. Despite their subpar customer service on other products, I thought the lower price would be a good palliative measure to ease any disappointment.No disappointment here, though. Loud enough to cause ringing ears (but please don't go that far) and clear enough you can make out all the tiny nuances and even some of the more obscured instruments in your music. Just what I needed, so for once, Sony got it 95% right rather than their usual 60%. The one thing I don't like is the short cord. I have to plug it in at the front of my PC rather than to the sound card. A short extension solves that problem, but still, I'd have preferred to have another 18 inches or so on the cord.But hey, I have my music, which is all I wanted.

Amazing sound",5.0,Amazon Customer,2024-09-14,"Sound is at least on par with my $60-80 skullcandy over-ear headphones. It has excellent bass (metal and dubstep sound good) and bass clarity. Mid range is excellent as well (rock sounds good), but it gives up a little clarity toward the upper end of the range--classical music is OK as a result.

Long lasting functionality",5.0,Caitlyn,2024-08-20,"NOTE: The attached pictures are of my (six year old) pair.I bought an identical pair (same brand, color, etc) a few years back when I graduated high school. I really liked them and they are an affordable price, so I bought this pair for my sister.My pair has worked well all these years and still provides excellent sound quality. It has been almost six years and they are just now starting to wear. The ear cushions are tearing off and a tiny bit of the paint is beginning to chip - and this is after almost daily use for five and a half years and carrying them around in my backpack half the time. I personally don't mind the tearing as they still hold together well enough and I don't notice the tearing when wearing the headphones - the cushion itself is still good. The mic still works great and so does the sound functionality. I imagine they will last many more years to come.These headphones are adjustable and the ears are even labeled: ""R"" for ""Right ear""; ""L"" for ""Left ear"".",the United States,True,19,RMH87PR0Q9RA2

Good for some cheapo's",4.0,Dustin M,2024-08-09,"I needed a pair of headphones for a work thing because I couldn't use my bluetooth.. so this is what I chose and have since passed them on to my son for school.  They work fine, have an in-line microphone. Sound quality is about what you'd expect from a lower-mid quality set. What I had an issue with was the ear cups sitting on my ears. After a while it began to hurt and made my ear sweat a little. I knew it was coming, it's like that with all these on-the-ear sets.. I mean that's why they call them ""ON the ear"", right? So, I'm not complaining really, just saying that's what I didn't like about them. I don't regret the purchase.

Not loud enough",3.0,Ramon Hernandez,2024-08-08,"Man I am so disappointed. I've brought lower budget Sony headphones before that were adequate but they were ear buds. Although these have clear sound and okay bass, it gets 3 stars but the volume is not great at all even at max.I honestly don't even listen to overly loud volume. In fact the ear buds from Sony, I rarely was able to put at max volume but these are absolutely dull. They don't wrap your ears too well so it less viable to reduce outside noise.

Surprisingly good travel headphones for the price.",5.0,JLC,2025-01-20,"This is a Boomer review since younger people know much more about headphones than I do, and everyone has them.  But for those who only use headphones on the plane, especially for the noise canceling feature, this is for you.  I specifically looked for plug-in headphones because they are more comfortable than earbuds, and more reliable than bluetooth.  No, these are not Bose headphones, but hilariously, they rank second to Bose on many reviewers' lists!I bought these to replace my 15 year old Audio Technica headphones that still work but are falling apart.  I took both pairs with me on a recent trip and did a comparison.  I could not tell a difference between them, even though the Audio Technica ones covered my ears better.  When not watching movies I wore them just for the noise-cancelling feature, which worked just fine.  I am a relatively small woman so larger people might have a different experience with ear coverage.  These earphones fold up and become quite compact so they don't take up much room in your carry-on bag.  They fit neatly into small, semi-circular cases that are readily available on Amazon, and which  I highly recommend.  The nearly identical version of these headphones at about half the price does not have the noise canceling feature.

takes some abuse",5.0,J C Sullivan,2025-01-19,"I have gone thru a couple of pairs of these over the years, and the reason I replace them is that I did something to damage them. So lets be realistic about what you are getting. You are getting a pair of portable headphones that will REDUCE any surrounding noise to the point that whatever you are trying to listen to can be heard. They are not going to silence the surrounding noise, no open element headphone can. These are not the headphones I use when I am flying a plane, but they are the ones I use when I am flying commercially on a A320 and watching movies or listening to music. The battery life is very good, they fold up to reduce the amount of space they take up in your carry on, and they have a nice long cord . IMHO great bang for the buck.",the United States,False,0,R37GOHECGJ5YMS

Not Noise Cancelling -- Only amplifies incoming signal",1.0,Benjamin Wisniewski,2025-01-06,"This product does not actively cancel noise. Unlike normal noise cancelling headphones, there is no discernible decrease in ambient noise when switched ""on"" without a music source. I tested the product using my loud kitchen fan (and yes, I installed the batteries). Instead of cancelling noise, the ""on"" button appears to amplify the incoming signal, like a ""loud"" button on an old stereo.

Basically false advertising.",2.0,Amazon Customer,2025-01-04,"My sister got these for me for Christmas, knowing that i was looking for noise cancelling headphones so I wasn’t destroying my hearing. A big part of noise canceling headphones is that you don’t need to turn music up loud to hear since all outside noise is tuned out. Sony said on the box that it removes 95% of noise. That’s not true at all. I have to turn them up just as loud as my $10 wireless earbuds. The sound quality is okay but it removes maybe about 50% of ambient noise. Also, the sound quality is only good when turned up. These get quite dull and somewhat muddy at low volume which again makes them basically useless as advertised. They’re just cheap over ear headphones. That’s it. I’d be fine with them if they weren’t trying to claim 95% noise cancellation. Find something else. You also have to use a battery which is fun, I love listening to music only for the battery to die halfway through. They’re not rechargeable batteries either, it’s a physical battery. That’s just annoying in this day and age. I don’t want to spend a ton of money on batteries, we know they aren’t cheap anymore, and it makes so much additional waste. Buy something else.",the United States,False,0,RZ15LTSIBC9RZ

Excellent headphones",4.0,J.Ish,2025-01-04,"The sound quality is good and the noise cancelling is as good as my husband's previous more expecnsive headphones.  The ear pad area is smaller making the headphones easier to wear for a long period of time.  The only drawback to these headphones is the  two wires coming from each side of the earpieces,  instead of one wire coming from only one side.  The one sided wired headphones  are usually only found in more expensive headphones with larder earpieces. The two wires is the only reason  I gave these headphones 4 stars instead of 5.",the United States,True,1,R1MDF22RO0PGNT

On the ear headphones do not work for me in a noise cancelling environment",3.0,Alpha L,2024-12-04,I have used this on four flights.  The noise cancelling seems nonexistent to the point I checked to see if the battery was in correctly. It is inexpensive enough I will just keep it and try another one.  I have other expensive brands which work much better but I travel very light and they take up too much room in my backpack with the other electronic gear I need to carry. I do like the small size and they work well in a quieter setting.  It could be because it fits on the ear and not around the ear; so it could be my problem and not the headphones.,the United States,True,4,R37R2JSI9NYTUY

Worked great on plane but hurt after 2 hours",4.0,Amazon Customer,2024-04-11,Bought these for a trip and was excited to try them out on the plane.  They actually did a really good job with canceling out the noise of the plane!  They're wired so you an use them without batteries if your batteries every run out (but it won't sound so good).  Even found the perfect case to go with these on Amazon that was so cheap. The only thing I struggled with was that they started to hurt my ears (since they're not over the ear headphones) and the top of my head (no padding) after about 2 hours.  I've tried using them at Starbucks when working and same thing happens.  These are great for short-time use. I used them at the gym for 40-ish minutes and they were great!  But might be uncomfortable for you for long-term use.  The price is great though!,the United States,True,3,R2AN416H2J7LWA

Good, basic headphones (but noise cancelling does not work)",2.0,Peter E.,2024-01-07,"I've owned several pairs of the ""non"" noise-cancelling Sony MDR-ZX110 (which runs $10 - $15 on Amazon).  It's a good, basic headphone.  The noise-cancelling on the model being reviewed (the Sony MDR-ZX110NC) requires a battery (a non-rechargeable battery is provided) but does not work as used expect (it just boosts the bass and the volume).

Huge Drop In Quality- Don‘t Buy",1.0,Hilary,2025-08-04,"I first started buying these headphones a year or two ago when the first pair broke after a year of use. Not a big deal and they were only 30 dollars and lasted so long, so I bought another pair.  That had a sharp drop in quality and rise in price, resulting in them breaking in about 4 months. For some foolish reason, I bought another pair for now $50. These ones barely lasted two weeks before snapping. I‘m not rough with my headphones, I don’t take them on rocket ships or beat them with hammers- they stay on my head or by my desk and somehow manage to snap themselves as i leaned against the wall. Seriously, how do headphones snap from leaning gently against a wall? I‘m a little teenage girl, not a body builder or the type to slam my head against walls. You’re better off buying anything else, all these other good reviews are outdated.",the United States,True,0,R1T9UQECRSN0V8

Immediately impressive.",5.0,Fatt Matt,2025-09-06,"Sound- 8/10Not perfect yet soooo good especially considering the price point. A little bit more noticable idle noise than more expensive headphones. Heavy on the bass and lacks sparkle by default. Get the Soundcore app, you can balance it out nicely with a custom EQ, or the ""Lounge"" preset does a pretty good job. But even without custom settings, you simply can't beat these for 20 bucks. Especially if you like to hear the full spectrum of bass, straight down to 20hz. These can go very loud as well.Fit/Comfort - 8/10Depending on how you set them on your ears can impact the perceieved sound, this is just a general disadvantage of on ear headphones. These clamp down comfortably and do a great job blocking out backround noise passively. They're pretty lightweight so easy to walk around with. Might be a bit too loose for more intense workouts, though.Build quality - 10/10At 20 bucks these are very nice. Lightweight but sturdy build. They fold up nicely for travel or storage as well.Features/functions - 10/10App with a 9 band customizable EQ,Multipoint pairing,Wireless and wired input options (Aux cable included),Folds up nicely,Seemingly endless battery life,All for 20 bucks!?

Headband cushion peeled, but great product other than that.",4.0,Elise Melinn,2025-07-16,"Still great sound quality after probably a year at this point of continuous use(besides charging and off time). Unlike other brands of headphones the ear cushions are still fine. The headband cushion on the other hand isn't. I've had to tape it up because the cushion cover was peeling away from the cushion. Probably means it's time to replace the cushion, but I'm not an expert on how to replace headphone cushions of any kind so...small duck tape roll it is until the sound or connectivity goes. Love the way it folds for travel, means I can fit it in my purse well. Also appreciate the L and R on the inside of the ear cushions area.

Way better than most, more expensive headphones 100%",5.0,Whitney,2025-07-13,"I got these during Prime Day for $20 and I am so impressed. Even at the regular price, Souncore H30i will by far exceed any expectations.I bought JBL 520 headphones and returned them because they weren’t very loud, the bass wasn’t what I was looking for, and the ear cups came off way too easily. Then I bought these to check out instead the following day. The difference is honestly insane. Soundcore H30i are surprisingly loud, as in loud enough that turned all the way up hurts your ears almost, and the bass is heavy. It doesn’t even matter for me that they aren’t noise canceling because I couldn’t hear anyone when they tried to talk to me today at work when I was blasting EDM and cleaning. They seem to be pretty sturdy and a plenty comfortable fit for my head. My job is physical and I’m moving up and down a lot, they didn’t slide off at all which was wonderful. I’m definitely happy about this purchase!I also appreciate soundcore for having fast charging headphones throughout, I don’t think I’ve ever had a pair die on me before I got them to a charger!

Two different pairs broke the exact same way.",1.0,InhabitsOldCar,2025-01-14,"UPDATE: Anker very generously offered to send me a new set of these headphones, which I accepted, in hopes that the “third time’s a charm” rule would ring true! I definitely respect Anker for their efforts to make things right by their customers.Unfortunately, eventually the new headphones met the same end, snapping at the same weak spot at the joint between the band and earpiece, despite that I was EXTRA careful with them this time because of my past experiences.Anker puts out some great products—I own several—this just doesn’t happen to be one of them.————-I loved these headphones - great sound quality for the price, comfortable, understated aesthetics; these headphones checked all the right boxes for me. That is, until they broke at the thin joint between the band and the earpiece.I take very good care of my headphones, even the crappy-quality ones I just like for their unique looks. And I definitely took care of these Soundcores. So when they snapped at the joint, I figured maybe I got a flawed set, and didn’t think twice about purchasing a replacement.Sadly, the second pair snapped at the very same joint.Needless to say I won’t be purchasing a third pair, nor can I recommend anyone else do so. They’ll only make you love them, then turn around and break your heart.",the United States,True,9,R239T1RAKFH794

Comfortable, quality sound, great bluetooth",5.0,craig of course,2024-12-08,"I bought the h10 (holiday sale $22) to use with a 9 band equalizer. I'm not yet willing or ready for hearing aids! I used an optical splitter (BlueRigger Toslink digital optical audio splitter adapter around $8). Connect splitter to TV optical output and one port goes to soundbar and other port to the digital to analog decoder which ill describe  in a minute. I can now hear 2KHz and above thx to the equalizer (behringer mini fbq800 from Sweetwater.com around $70). BTW, I have Bose OVER the ear ANC ($$$$) but wanted simple ON the ears and h10 is perfect ($). My wife likes the sound very low from the soundbar and I can now turn up the headphones volume to add many more years to a happy marriage. As for gear, connect TV optical to OREI DA34 digital to analog decoder audio converter (this unit processes the all-important Dolby signal and PCM) around $30. Connect the DA34 to the equalizer. In order to provide Bluetooth, output the equalizer to a wireless Bluetooth transmitter. I use the MEE audio Connect around $20. Turn on TV, equalizer, put h10 into pairing mode (press button for 5 sec) and press MEE button. Voila. Yes, there is a very slight audio latency with Bluetooth in the headphones, but the soundbar volume is low and the earphones is a bit higher so it is not distracting for me. If the soundbar is off, it's all moot.",the United States,True,0,RIN5YCAJBQ7SZ

Fantastic Portable headphones.",5.0,Devin D. Bass,2024-11-20,These are great portable headphones they fold nicely and store easily in your backpack. I recommend you buy a hard shell case to protect these headphones.  They hold a charge for a long time I would say about12 to 14 hours.  The sound quality is excellent the bass is very strong and crystal clear.  I don't think they are marketed as noise cancelling but when I am wearing them I don't hear much from the outside.  They have a strong fit very snug. I think If you have a Large head these might be too tight.  These are great sounding affordable headphones.

Done With Buds Forever, Incredible Value",5.0,D. Glassner,2024-10-18,"I collect headphones, or as some might say, I'm a headphone hobbyist. In my collection are HiFiMan, Sennheiser, and AKG high-end headphones. I always used a set of buds for knocking around, walking the dog, and talking on the phone. My last two pairs were from Soundcore, including Liberty Pro 3s which I paid over $100 for. They were okay, but despite trying many different tips, they would fall out of my ear, not provide a good seal, I'd accidentally hang-up on folks by pushing a bud back into my ear or eventually get clogged with earwax.This time when it came time to replace my buds I thought I'd try something different. Despite my bad experiences with buds, I've always appreciated the value, sound, and features of Soundcore products. Because I have no use for gimmicks like noise-canceling, etc., I looked through the line-up to see which set of Soundcore cans had none of those useless (to me) features and found these for $25-ish.As far as price-to-quality ratio, these are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. The microphone is stellar (it sounds as good as most podcasts I listen to, even better than some), the sound for listening to calls or podcasts is great, and to my surprise, music sounds better than virtually any bud I've ever owned. And even music sounds great, which was not even my main usage for these. Do they have as flat and detailed of a response as my best, open-back headphones...? Of course not. They have a bit of boost in the bass, like many less expensive earphones. However, even this can be adjusted with the EQ in the free SoundCore app.Much to my surprise, given that they don't even cover the entire ear, wearing them even without anything playing seems to block out about 85% of outside noise. I will say, they fit very snugly, some might even say tight. My head must be on the smaller side, because I rarely have to extend headphones beyond the smallest size, and still they are VERY snug. I doesn't bother me, but they might become uncomfortable after an hour or two. However, I don't use these for long listening sessions... I have many, much better wired headphones for that.These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever had, including my first pair ever, my now long-gone $300 Sony MDR-1R. For $25! For that money, I was expecting something with good utility for my purposes. What I got was a really fun pair of cans.",the United States,True,28,R3DIOPSYV8ISPY

Absolutely best fullsize headphones for price to performance",5.0,John Glen,2024-10-05,"Anker always comes through with excellent products that hit the sweet spot on price without compromises in features. The H30i has an awesome battery life that's taken me multiple days to totally run through. The microphone quality is great for phone calls and I never have issues with clarity. Audio quality is great, bass is great. The buttons are just what you need and nothing unnecessary yet give a satisfying and responsive click. The H30i's USB-C port is great and let's you get rid of your outdated USB Micro-B cables. The earcups have the ability to swivel and spin together with an adjustable band for improved comfort. The design is professional yet elegant. The H30i even supports a headphone jack. Unfortunately, the H30i's internal microphone does not work while wired, but you can buy an aux cable with an inline microphone to use the H30i as a proper headset even while wired.

I like em!",4.0,Big Trev,2024-09-30,"I don't much care for over ear headphones, so I went with these. The only missing component is another microphone (to block out background noise while on calls), and noise canceling. But I know what I bought, so that's not a fault of the product. Liked so much I bought another set.I will add that the oblong shape of the headband does cause some ear discomfort after wearing for a while, since they don't sit ""flat"" as much as the swivels help align them on the ear. Maybe it's just my head shape or ear placement, but a similar set from another brand doesnt have this problem since the headband is more rounded.",the United States,True,2,RTMR4Z26GZC39

Great Headphones!",5.0,Amazon Customer,2024-09-11,So here's my story my wife and I were on a trip to San Antonio TX and I forgot to pack my Beats Studio headphones for the plane. So we went to Ross in Albuquerque and I found these Anker Souncore H30i headphones for $20 all I can say is WOW! They have great bass clarity and to be honest they are louder than my Beats I paid $200 for on sale. Now the noise cancelling isn't as good as the Beats and the comfort is so so BUT overall for $20 had I knew these were that good I wouldn't have over spent. Moral of story you don't have to spend $200 to get great sound from headphones. I will be buying more Anker Souncore products,the United States,False,0,R2O8ZDHV21GQHM

Soundcore used to be my favorite brand**Update!!!",5.0,Darcy Mhor,2024-09-05,"I bought these after giving my nicer noise cancelling over hear soundcore headphone to my husband yo help him with migraines. These arecheaper but really only needed them to game on my desktop computer. They are not as comfortable and can really hurt if you don’t have them setting just so but they do what I need them for at a good price and battery life is endless. I’ve had these less than 60 days and was shocked to find the bezel(?) cracked and  one part on the floor. I blamed myself although I’m older now and not very hard on things, I spent $17 for a generic case. Then I realized the other side was cracked the same way. True it doesn’t affect the use but it’s just a bad design. I will update after contacting customer service although since the pandemic customer service is pointless 99.9% of the time.***Update. Soundcore customer service is AMAZING! Been meaning to update this for a white. I contacted Soundforge and they went above and beyond. Got my replacement in 2 Days!!

When it says Free Returns be aware there is no QR scan code available, must take to UPS preboxed and labeled (need printer to do that) or pay $7.99 to UPS for label.

Obnoxious Interference",4.0,Marilynn B,2023-08-30,"Usually, I prefer to use wireless ear buds, but I use them for hours a day and was getting frustrated when needing to take them out to charge. As an alternative, I looked at over the ear wired headphones that connected with a c-type USB, but I definitely didn't want to spend more than $30 on a pair since they'd be my in-between while my buds charge, so here we are with the Kensington headphones. Overall, they are very good - sound quality is great, and despite the ear coverage not being a tight seal, enough ambient noise is blocked so that I can enjoy the music, but not so blocked that I can't hear important background noises (doorbell, kids screaming, etc.). They are comfortable on my ears and on my head, which hasn't been my experience in the pas with headphones. That said, there is random and often obnoxious interference that comes through, and I can't pinpoint if maybe it's something with my phone or some kind of external interference from a computer or something like that, but it does seem that no matter where I set my phone, the interference happens. If you've ever used dial-up internet, you will remember the unique tapping that would emit through computer speakers just before the phone rang, and that is not only the type of interference, but has many times been the exact sound I get. All-in-all, even with that interference, these are good headphones.",the United States,True,6,R27SK5AFDETXIH

Plug and Play, no complicated buttons whatsoever, exactly what you need!",5.0,Just_Another_Amazon_Shopper,2023-08-18,"I usually don't write reviews. When I do, it's because a product actually solves my problem.You see, almost all the headset you find on Amazon all comes with a few buttons, and ""long press here to turn on"" and ""push that button to pause/play"" that kind of stuff. All that does is to confuse the consumer. I need to buy a headset for a senior family member, I cannot teach them to do ""long press"" here and ""pause/play"" there. I need a headset that behaves like an old school headset: just plug it in and it works!This headset does JUST THAT!

I've grown to dislike earbuds for a number of reasons and I've gone back to cans.What's that...? You're going to make me say something negative? *sigh* Oh alright: they're a little snug and my reading glasses make grooves in my head when I wear these for a few hours.

At first I thought maybe it was a dumb power saving attempt, where if you didn't touch them or your phone for awhile they'd shut off, but I quickly disproved that. It is the single most frustrating thing I have to deal with on a daily basis. Sometimes when they shut off they'll go into automatic pairing mode when I turn them back on, so that's another fun little quirk with these pieces of garbage.

Not suitable for my needs as a constant user.",3.0,Kat,2025-05-01,"I’m a nearly 24/7 headphones wearer so have a lot of important criteria. My current daily drivers are the skullcandy uproar wireless, which have been frustratingly discontinued, so… the search begins. First and foremost, my headphones need to be comfortable and they can not make me overheat. These were both a little uncomfortable, and already made me feel too warm within just a few minutes of wear. I specifically gave these a chance because another reviewer said they didn’t cause overheating, but this was not the case for me. A lot of the discomfort was from the tightness of the band, which will loosen over time so I’m willing to forgive it, but the ear cups—while decently soft and squishy—seemed to reflect my own body heat back at me and amplify it. This would make them unwearable for even an hour, let alone a full day. I will say that I appreciated the design of how the band is adjusted, because they adjust higher up, meaning it gives both a little more width and a little more length than other, similar designs. Many headphones continue to squeeze your ears tight to the side of your face no matter how long the extension is, but the additional widening helped enough that I can see how they’d be very comfortable with some wearing in.These sound excellent, which I’ve come to expect from Skullcandy. The sound is clear and un-muffled, and does not feel lacking. I don’t really know the differences in sound descriptions and words, but skullcandy has always sounded very, very good to me when it comes to listening to every kind of media I can think of.The buttons are too small to quickly find when you need to pause or adjust the volume, and I pause my sound a significantly high number of times per day, so this would be a problem. I could add dots of puffy paint to them if I wanted to make them more prominent, but I’d already decided these weren’t keepers. They’re also grouped really closely together and feel sort of “mushy” when you press them, which makes the physical act of doing so a bit difficult if your fingertips are hyperflexible. The absolute distaste I have for these buttons was a HUGE part of rejecting the headphones overall, as well as the fact there seems to be a bit of a delay when you press play/pause to when it actually activates. So on top of pressing the button being a slow event, the action itself is slowed, as well. No thanks.All in all, these are not the WORST headphones I’ve ever tried, but I decided in less than an hour they weren’t worth a hoot at all for me.If you’re also a nonstop headphones user, I’d recommend finding something else for your daily driver.",the United States,True,0,R1YCAW47CDQXAE

Delivers great sound for budget phones, but...",4.0,JPTRO,2025-04-28,"For the price you pay, these headphones deliver a great sound with a balanced range and ample bass. By comparison, I purchased these to replace an older set of Beats Studio HD headphones and was pleasantly surprised that the Skullcandy's sounded better than the Beats.The fit is good, even with my larger knoggin' and the on-ear cushions are very soft. That lead me to one of my negatives. The fabric that encloses the earpieces is very flimsy and I can see these fraying or tearing very easily. Another drawback is the chord. It is short and it is fixed to the headphones so there is no replacing it with a longer chord.Even with the negatives, I found these headphones to be a great value for the price and am very happy with the quality of sound they put out",the United States,True,3,R2E34EWRUJ9V7I

I’m very dissatisfied with these headphones. You can barely turn up the volume withought the people around u hearing ur music, unfortunately that ruins them for me. But they are very comfortable and if u don’t mind the volume struggles they arnt the worst. This is a video of my freind wearing them and turning up and down the volume . As h can hear its very easy to hear the music.",the United States,True,4,RHX1HG1R94LGW

Note that these headphones have a USB-C connection; they don't use older 3.5mm or quarter-inch headphone jacks so make sure your source device supports USB-C headphones.

About what you'd expect from JBL, really great baseline product.",5.0,Mo and Dan,2025-05-13,"Grabbed these up for yardwork and casual listening, and they’ve been awesome. Sound quality is super clear like you would expect from a JBL product. You get that nice thump without drowning out the mids and highs, which is exactly what I want in a pair of headphones.For on-ear style, the comfort’s actually better than I expected. Usually, these things start mashing and pinching my ears after a bit, but I’ve worn these for a few hours at a time with no problem. Soft pads, lightweight build, just a good fit.Bonus points for the inline controls sticking to the industry standard format instead of doing something ""new and improved.""

Sound is better than the price indicates",4.0,EarGoggles,2025-05-12,"These sound very, very good for what are essentially budget headphones. The USB-C DAC used in these is clean sounding and the drivers delivery clarity and some low-end slam. I didn't expect such a mature sound from these plastic low-cost headphones.The build and fit, however, leave a little to be desired. I don't mind the on-ear design, but the way this headband is shaped (circular instead of slightly oval/oblong) means the sides of the headphones stand out quite a bit from the sides of your head.

They are comfortable with the padded ear donuts that are satin-like and soft, with a bit of firmness yet still conform to the contours of the ear. The cord is long enough to have your phone or plug in a backpack, pocket, or on your person and still have slack. The included in-line microphone and controls work well, and can be used for calls if needed. The sound has a great range! With some of my guitar rock, hip hop, edm playlists they produced great low bass and clean high end for clarity in audio.

Great for bass lovers",5.0,Dagger,2025-05-08,"I always appreciate the fidelity of decent wired headphones over those with Bluetooth connections. These didn't disappoint, with a few qualifications.I compared them to a few other major brand on-ear wired headphones and these definitely had the best bass response and a good clean sound.Bass was strong and clean, definitely the main feature of these headphones, and a great reason to get them if you like powerful bass. But in all three EQ settings I found the mids and treble to be a bit weak compared to the other headphones I compared these to. Although weak in my opinion, the sound across all frequency ranges was very clean... much better than lower quality headphones.The microphone placement on the control module allows for good clean voice pickup (better than microphones located on headphone cups or earbuds). It does a good job masking the sound of the cable rubbing on your shirt (which some others don't).They don't come with any documentation, so here are a few tips. To toggle the EQ among bass-favoring, voice-favoring, or default, you need to hold down the volume ( + and - ) buttons simultaneously for 2 seconds. The setting will be announced as it switches. Tap the center button to pause/play, hold it briefly to activate voice commands (like Siri).These headphones fold flat for storage and the headband is adjustable, but they lack horizontal pivots on the earcups, so depending on your head shape they may press harder on the bottoms or tops of your ears. I didn't find this to be a big deal and they were comfortable enough on my big head.Overall, these are great sounding for the price, and if you're a bass lover you'll really enjoy them.",the United States,False,2,RQE5KDKCIQ5SA

Good for a pinch but sound too soft",3.0,Jorge,2025-05-31,These headphones were very cheap in price at the time. I tested these on my Nintendo 3DS and my phone. After testing they were just not loud enough or provide enough bass for my needs. The cups do fold inwards so you can quickly take them off your ears as needed.Major strengths are the price and rotatable cups.

Porta pros on a budget",5.0,Ian Podbielski,2025-05-21,"If you are looking for audio on a budget these little guys are hard to pass on. The Flats nearest competitor are the classic Koss Porta Pros. Both provide fantastic sound at great prices, but differ in two big ways. Firstly the JVCs cost 1/3 to 1/4 of a pair of Pros(which honestly makes them so hard to pass on) and secondly the sound. The Flats really live up to their name and have a great flat tone across genres vs the Pros. If you don't want to shell out the extra 20-30 for a warmer tone buy them and regret nothing. As a side note on durability you could probably break a pair of Porta Pros with a pair of Flats. I know that's not saying a heck of a lot(Porta Pros are held together by 2 plastic nubs and dreams), but you can expect them to survive a bag or a tumble without burning 30-40 for a new set",the United States,True,0,RKNDQA37EOFXH

Shouldn't sound or feel this good for $13 ( PortaPro alternative )",5.0,Doug B,2025-04-09,"I bought these along with the somewhat coveted JLabs Rewind ( gen 2 ) Bluetooth headphones. I bought both because I've been looking for something that won't cause me physical ear fatigue or hurt immediately upon wearing.I REALLY wanted to love the JLabs because they offer something that the JVC Flats cannot.... No wires.  I LOATHE wires.That said. I will take the cables on these JVC Flats ANY day of the week because of what they offer over the JLabs Rewind.  Before I state what that is exactly, let me just say that the JLabs are about as comfortable as the JVC Flats.  Maybe more... But not quite,  without modifications.  I'll explain, because it's relevant.I have small ears.  And small ear canals. This is why I can't wear in-ear buds for too long, and is also why certain headphones hurt my ears or skull, depending upon how where and how they sit on my head and ears. It's a freaking curse.I started looking for headphones where one of the main selling points is being lightweight and comfortable.  Both these JVC'S and JLabs seemed to fit the bill when looking at their descriptions and reviews.  So, I bought both.I went into buying the JVC Flats knowing there was no mic or volume control, which I am actually fine with.  So I won't ding ding a star for it.What I wasn't expecting from the JVC Flats though.... Was how freaking good the sound quality would be! I have had several pairs of JVC marshmallow in ears, and now that I think about it, those sounded great, and are like fifteen bucks, so... Maybe I shouldn't be surprised?I should not that I also primarily wanted these for podcasts.  But when I heard the JVC Flats, I put on some music and was kind of floored.They instantly reminded me of Koss PortaPros, but with a tad more forward low and mid bass, maybe?  I used the PortaPros A LOT in my 20s and 30s and am now 53, so I've lost frequency range throughout the years.And they're LOUD! I don't need them to be this loud, but this is a terrible issue with the JLabs Rewind.  They're incredibly low.  Maybe lower voltage to increase battery life, but it's horrible.I'd have to put the volume to about 85% on the JLabs for basic, comfortable listening levels, whereas with these JVC'S, it's about 40% or less.  Fantastic.  And again, loud means nothing if it's loud and garbage.  These are loud and clear with no real bass mushiness even at uncomfortably loud levels.  Crystal clear.  Awesome.They fit snug on my ears, and the ear pads are cushy and fairly soft.  The outer layer is that faux leather material that always seems to eventually tear on headphones, so we'll see on that one....My only wish is that the actual driver housing was a TAD wider because while the driver seems to be positioned perfectly against my ear canal, the housing edges kind of hit the edges of my ear, causing some minor discomfort.Someone with normal, non-freakishly small ears, (which is most people), won't be bothered by this I guess.  What else. The head band, even though it has no padding, is barely noticeable.  Likely due to how light the frame is.  The band adjustment gives you a really pleasing tactile single groove click when adjusting.  Nice touch.I might give the JLabs a slight win in comfort, but ONLY if changing the foam pads on them, to something more foamy/cushy and soft.  As they are, the JLabs driver housing is very rigid and  my ears really feel that.  If I kept them, I'd modify them with some extra foam.  Otherwise, they're lighter than the JVC 's with a smaller earpiece frame.I might actually try to modify these JVC ear ups to make them wider.  I'll likely also buy a few spare sets because this pair is a gem.Great job JVC.If there's one negative thing I can say about them, it's that they're not being made with USB-C instead of just the 3.5mm input plug.  I hate having to use dongles.  I already had one, but I hate cables as it is, so....Anyway, if you're cool with cables, don't have freak ears, and want something super comfortable and want very good sound quality at a STEAL of a price...( Get a few now before the tariffs double their price), GET THESE!P.S.PortaPros are more detailed and have better soundstage.  But for $13 bucks, these are the ONES to beat.",the United States,True,11,R3954R1G6MF1ZJ

Excellent sound but they break too easy!",3.0,Natja K.,2025-03-29,"These really do have excellent sound, far better than you might imagine for the price. The bad news is they break really easy and I've been through several pairs. As long as you're very gentle with them they should last a while. The main culprit is right where the ear cup connects to the headband and that's pretty much where they all broke. The actual headband is it's very durable. Also the cable that leads from it is very thin so you have to be gentle with that too. They really do sound phenomenal but JVC should do something about it's durability because I've been through five pairs of these over the years and they all broke in the same exact place. One or the other ear cup breaks off work connects. My current pair I just glued it back on with super glue and made sure it was angled right to fit on my ear properly.",the United States,True,6,R2ZFFOH0QQLNNR

A 2017 purchase. An appreciation.",4.0,MS Globetrotter,2025-02-24,"I bought these for my late mother in 2017 to listen to music and help with TV. A perfect low cost choice. I took them out of storage to provide TV audio while my spouse sleeps. And they still work. As hoped. These are not the right choice for adult critical music listening sessions. But they do offer surprisingly satifying sound during long sessions like binge watching or podcast listening. They're lightweight so I barely notice them on ears or bald head. When music appears in a soundtrack or guest appearance, they often impress me with how restrained but noticeable the bass is-- again these are not appropriate for critical listening-- but great for the purposes I'm using this for. I've just added this to my list because sooner or later these will give out. But I figured while I'm in Amazon, I owed others the benefit of my experience.

Incredibly Underrated Cans",4.0,Jennifer Click,2024-10-31,"If you are looking for one of the best kept secrets in headphones for both audiophiles and general listeners? Here she is, the Flats. Been around for many years, this has been a staple for me in my headphone journey. I’ve used a couple pairs on/off from 2012-as I write.With that said, the Flats aren’t for all. Let’s get that out of way! Big bass lovers, you look elsewhere. Need really great isolation, nah you can hear babies crying with these. Want a modern, sleek look? These have been around long enough to be retro now and kind of look it!That said, the sound and comfort are punching well above the price and looks would suggest. These cans provide a sound I would describe as: well balanced, mostly smooth but some sparkle in the treble. Clarity is slightly above average thanks to air and the treble crispness. Mid range feels a tad recessed but timbre is natural. Out of box they might sound somewhat metallic, let them play for several hours. That should go away. Bass, good punch, mostly a mid bass type of sound. Somewhat thick sounds but not rumbly or dark. A subtle V shape sounding headphone, which pleases most listeners.The comfort is top shelf. Due to their minimal design and weight, all cheap does help some things; I  can wear these hours and no fatigue. Cushions on the ear are just decent but keeps a loose seal to keep sound rich. But they rest on ear and are about the size of an average ear. So you should feel comfy and ears not too hot!At 12$, you are getting a killer value in headphones. Simple, basically timeless sound and design, and easy on the wallet?! It’s an easy recommendation! Remember, it’s not for those wanting Dre bass. It’s a balanced and clean set of cans. It will suit most genres other than those demanding pumping bass. Rock, metal, pop, mainstream, country; they all sound so crisp. Pick the color you like, and enjoy. The Royale blue color, it really pops in person.",the United States,True,3,R869FAMNXQOY6

I also wear them when doing work around the yard and construction work. Needless to say, I have snagged the cord many times to the point I thought I would have pulled it either out of the phones or even broken it. However all is still operating fine. I like wearing external phones so I can move them either onto or farther off of my ears to regulate volume and adjust for need to hear traffic. When directly over my ears the fidelity is very good for music considering my need for light-weight comfort while running or working.

Generally Great; Minor Complaint about Material",4.0,David Cyr,2024-09-11,"I recently bought my second pair of these HA-S160 headphones, to replace my previous pair.  For sound and comfort, I've been completely happy with them.  I use them when seated at my PC, to listen to music and watch videos, for moderate stretches of time (never really lengthy).  My only complaint is a material issue --- the outermost part of the foam earpads are covered with an extremely thin plastic/rubber-like membrane, and over time the membrane has come apart and is falling/peeling away from the foam.  This is the sole reason I decided to replace my old pair with a new pair.  My old pair is several years old, however, so it took a while for the material to deteriorate.  Despite this issue, and considering how happy I've been with them otherwise, plus the fact that the price is quite affordable, I recommend these headphones as a good product.",the United States,False,0,R1FN7ZM1T80BN9

The savings aren't worth it",1.0,Rena,2024-09-01,"While I've been a loyal customer to Philips for a long time and usually satisfied, this time they've let me down. Sound quality is a steep downgrade from comparably priced headsets to such a degree that they fall into a lower tier entirely. Connectivity is unreliable and often requires multiple disconnects and reconnects just to work properly. Headphones will say ""device connected"" without actually being so. Worst of the lot though is the battery life. With a prior, similarly-priced headset I was able to go up to a week on a charge while this one can't get through the day. The battery life is only functionally 75% of the listed capacity, as every 90 seconds the headphones will interrupt your audio to repeat a ""BATTERY LOW"" voice warning. There is no way to turn this off and it will interrupt a single song two to three times, while the meter will show you having up to a quarter of your battery life left. The device can still be in the green on a battery meter and still will not function without being charged, in the most infuriating way imaginable. Budgeting in an extra $20 and going for a different brand will pay off to spare the frustration alone.",the United States,True,9,R2MIVKOAMW0EDM

It's great for me. I didn't need full nose cancellation as I mainly use them in the office so its cancels enough for me to zone out & work without distraction but still hear if my name is called. It's comfortable on my ears and don't hurt even after wearing for over 9 hrs straight. It's easy to pause your media or skip to next track & to pair to your devices.

Another example of a company ruining a product with absurd automatic functions",2.0,MC,2025-08-12,"I bought these to replace a pair of BT510 that broke in my carry-on during a flight a few weeks ago. These were in sale, so figured I'd try the better model. I can't stand them. I think they sound a little worse than the cheaper 210s, but this is another product completely ruined by trying to decide for you what you want to do, and doing it, whether it's okay with you or not. They have some absurd feature where they automatically send a mute / pause command to any connected device if you so much as slightly light one side off your ear. Well first off that's just annoying in the first place, but even if I was into that kind of thing, they're so over-sensitive, that I've been using them for about a full week now, and not a single day has gone by that they havent shut off my music from me taking a sip of a drink, talking, or even just sitting absolutely still. SO frustrating. I'm going to buy another set of 210s because no way these are working on a flight with my head touching a headrest. To make matters worse, the first time I paired them to my phone, the driver asked permissions to link to my Google account?!?!? WHY?!?! I said no, and it did it anyway. Ita none of Googles business what headphones I'm wearing, and my email address and phone info darn sure isnt any of JBLs business. Only giving them 2 stars because the sound quality is half way decent when they dont stop your music. Oh, and the icing on the cake is the mute button functions as a hang up button on Teams, so yah, these hung up on a work conference call because I moved my mouth, and they sensed movement on my head and decided that means I want to hang up. Don't recommend these for any use, because they do what they want, and providing bare minimum basic function a set of speakers attached to your ears, is not one of those things! They're also extremely uncomfortable on my head compared to the 510s that are less than half the price.",the United States,True,0,RTU61ANQUBCIM

Es cierto lo que comentan: cuando estás viendo videos en YouTube u otras plataformas, el modo de detección de movimiento para pausar el audio se activa constantemente cada vez que volteas la cabeza, lo cual se vuelve muy molesto.Sin embargo, eso no es lo peor. Lo más incómodo es lo ajustados que son. Aprietan demasiado, y eso que no tengo la cabeza grande. Para quienes usamos lentes, la experiencia es aún peor: no los recomiendo en absoluto, ni siquiera si están en oferta, porque ahí es cuando se nota realmente lo incómodos que son.No soy audiófilo, así que doy mi opinión como usuario común.

if you are a avid music listener i wouldnt suggest",3.0,T. S.,2025-02-18,"So at first I really thought these headphones were great. I didn’t know it had a siri function but apparently it does and i low key think thats so useless maybe cause i dont use siri. But anyways, the buttons are pretty cool theres a weird switch on button to power it but it turns on within like a second. Im glad about that cause I hate it when it takes 5 years to turn on like the other 30$ jbl headphones. Also the sound is pretty good and its really noise canceling that was also a shock factor, I could barely hear people talking. Now onto its faults, Maybe because they are new headphones and you kinda have to break into them but they were tight on my ears/head like crazy. I got two massive headaches from it and i like to listen to music alot and for prolonged periods of time. Yeah its definetly not meant to be worn for a long time. Your ears get super sore too. Also a really annoying thing I hate is the fact that when you put them on a little tune plays and when you take them off a tune plays again and it shuts off your music. Got to be thee most unecesary feature jesus christ. Ill literally adjust the headphone on my head while listening to something and it will pause and for gods sake that tune does not have to play all the damn time! Sometimes ill wear it half off and it will pause the video and play THAT TUNE OMG. Okay let me calm down, other than the useless siri function, the tightness of the headphones ,and the automatic pause feature, id say they are okay. Ive had better headphones like i shouldve just stuck to sony but they legit wont connect to anything. Thats also a pro about these headphones, they connect to literally anything. It took me 3 months to get my sony headphones to connect to my laptop and i had to do that through charging it from my laptop. And I still never managed to connect it to my Ipad. These headphones managed to do that all within an instant like i didnt have to wait five years, they also connected to my schools laptops which again my sony COULD NOT DO!!! ugh",the United States,True,2,R33FQXG7WYDYYZ

Great Quality, But Durability Could Be Better",4.0,ebony,2025-05-27,"Great Quality, But Durability Could Be BetterI bought these headphones for my 11-year-old to use with his school laptop, and overall, I was really happy with the purchase. They fit well, were comfortable to wear for long periods, and had good sound quality—perfect for schoolwork and occasional use at home.Unfortunately, they only lasted about half the school year. To be fair, my now 11-year-old can be pretty rough with his stuff. He didn’t use a case and often just tossed them into his backpack with books and other items. So while the durability wasn’t ideal, I still feel like the overall quality was solid for the price.In fact, I ended up purchasing another pair from the same brand to replace them.

Smaller than you think",2.0,Emmy,2025-05-03,"I've been using JLab's GO Air Sport for years now and love them, but the in-ear buds get really uncomfortable for me during extended wear, so I'm looking for an alternative when I'm not active enough I have to use the earbuds, but these are just total garbage :(I saw several reviews that mentioned how small they are, but didn't think much of it because I *have* small ears for an adult, but these are so small the pads barely even *cover* my ears, much less go around them like this style of headphone is generally supposed to do. I only wore them for a few minutes and they were already getting uncomfortable.I've had cheaper headphones that sounded better, and were more comfortable than these, which is too bad.For pros? They're cheap and they did pair really easily, so I mean, if you're looking for cheap headphones (maybe for a child, because of the size) they'd probably be fine.I do also really like the physical buttons on the headphones themselves, most brands don't bother with those anymore.

Nice overall sound with solid bass, good mids and highs---quite pleasant from a lower power source--I used a Surfans F20 as the sound source.  This is a an impressively well built set of phones with solid adjustment from the u-shaped can adjusters---they stick out a bit but that is the way the are built---fit good on smaller heads.  Unfortunately, they aren't great amplified. However, if you have an inexpensive MP3 player, these might be shockingly good at that level.  Strongly recommended for the low power user.

Not what I expected",2.0,Lights where easy to install sticking well so far remote works as long as there is not objects in the way down side the phone app does not work very lame but I guess for 20$ it's not a total loss,2024-12-30,First off for a product being just under 30$ it's really flimsy and I comes with a 4 inch charger in this case size does matter. Also according to the JLAB website these are intended for children when you look up the manual on the website it's under children's head set kinda lame but I guess that also explains why they are so damn small. 🦐 And for people who choose to get this product you will be able to register your set in the JLAB website and get a free item and or 3 months of tidel don't accidentally back out cuz that's it you won't be able to return to the site page and it will say you have already claimed your gift.... It comes dead so you'll need to charge it for a few hrs I'm sceptical of a 30 hour run time and it's not that great sounding... But if your buying this for a child it would be perfect 👌,the United States,True,0,R3HBTNFN5WLZGW

They're the most comfortable things I've ever worn over my ears. I have had zero issues with them. I did drop them on the pavement a few months after I got them and I think it broke something loose on the inside, but they still work incredibly well. Like if I didn't hear something rattling when I shook the headphones I wouldn't know there was any damage after the drop.I can't sing the praises of these headphones enough. I will suggest this to any one of my friends.",the United States,True,0,R1SRMVBXUK3HDW

SENSORY RELIEF",4.0,Rebugsy,2025-08-21,I have not used noise cancelling headphones before but after my confirmed Autism diagnosis I have realized much of what I thought was anxiety is actually sensory overwhelm. I decided to try these first to see if headphones are something that will help me before spending over $150 for the more recommended pairs.Upon just placing them on your head (not turning on) the sounds around me are already muffled. The moment I turned them on it was further improved and the holy-amazing-batman sound cancellation was clear the moment the noise cancelling turned on. Then when connected to my phone to play lofi music is the next best thing to being in a quiet room by myself. I have been wearing them for about twenty minutes and I already feel so relaxed whereas my child and mother are talking on the sofa next to me and only hear a light sound every couple minutes compared to the constant talking I would be hearing without that would slowly drive me to full blow irritation and aggravation. They have not started to bother my ears yet or give me a headache. Time will tell how they hold up and how long I can use them before getting uncomfortable.,the United States,True,1,R1FBWO0Q6NSDSZ

Decent",4.0,Gabby,2025-08-21,3.5 STARSI've been seeing these all over online and was waiting for them to go on sale. I don't think they are as great as everybody says they are but they are decent. Sound is great and easy to pair with devices. Noise cancellation is on par with my Sony's.  I do like they fold up for travel. My biggest complaint is they are a bit heavy and they creak when you move you head. So i wouldn't purchase if you are going to use these for running or working out. They also don't allow you plug in a headphone jack but i think that's common now a days.,the United States,True,0,R20TIMC66FGIYG

Good value solid BT headphones, middling ANC",4.0,oracleif,2025-08-14,"Viewed strictly as BT headphones, the JBUDS LUX are pretty decent.  I find the sound quite good for movies and fine for casual music listening.  The ANC and pass-through features are of some use, and the headphones are comfortable enough for, e.g., watching a movie, though the earcups don't ""breathe"" very well (I notice some reviewers refer to them as ""sweaty"", which is fair enough), so you'll probably want to take some breaks between calls (it makes a surprisingly good phone headset) or if listening to music for an extended period.  If you're interested in knowing more, details follow.USE CASE (you can skip this if not interested):Just to provide context, I'll mention I bought these at an attractive price for dedicated use with my living room TV, which supports Bluetooth but puts the pairing/unpairing bits behind such cumbersome menus, and behaves so badly with dual-connect BT devices (forcing you to completely reset BT volume, etc., when the headphone's interrupted by another device), that I prefer to just keep a pair of headphones paired exclusively to that TV.  Since I normally listen through a home theater sound system, I prefer to use more value-priced headphones for such occasional private-listening use.SOUND QUALITY:It's what headphones are for, and the JBUDS LUX does the basics competently.  They're replacing my old blue JBL E55BT phones (which were getting a bit the worse for wear, various bits of plastic trim breaking and the earcup cushions falling apart), and get pretty close to those in sound quality, the JBL being a bit ""brighter"", the JLAB's high end a bit more subdued, for what that's worth (no EQ tuning with the app for this comparison since I'm pairing them directly with a TV); as TV headphones they're kinda great.  I'm no audio  critic, but I've watched some music videos with them and there's nothing distracting about their performance, which is more than I can say for some other bargain headphones I've tried.  Switching to them directly from my Bose one can notice less distinct highs and less overall ""warmth"" to the sound, but heard on their own they're perfectly fine.ANC FEATURES:Overall noise-canceling performance is a bit unusual.  First off, hats off to JLAB for having an actual OFF option in the ANC control cycle, not just an ANC/aware toggle.  In cases where neither ANC nor pass-through is needed, turning those off maximizes the already long battery life, a welcome option.  Passive sound isolation is pretty good, so I usually have the ANC turned off.As for the ANC itself, my experience has differed from reviewers that claim turning on the ANC does less than the headphones' passive sound isolation, in that my own casual testing showed significant noise reduction.  It probably depends on what sounds you're trying to cancel - it works best at reducing the volume of continuous background noise like fans, road noise, etc., not so much for more transient sounds.  So it's somewhat effective and not very sophisticated, and that's about what I'd expect for this price point.  I won't be taking them on an airplane (where my Bose QC 45s do really well), so we'd need feedback from someone who's tried that for more of a torture test.The headphones' ""aware"" mode is a different matter, and unlike what I've experienced on other headphones offering a pass-through feature.  It's quite functional, but somewhat low fidelity.  While it's easy to hear your surroundings in this mode, sound quality is somewhat boxy/tinny, a bit better than an old landline phone (should you be old enough to recall ever hearing such a thing).  The Bose headphones mentioned above are my daily drivers for music and podcasts, and by comparison has such natural sounding pass-through I sometimes forget I have them on.  That's not something that would happen with the JBUDS LUX.MICROPHONE:Especially in light of the so-so pass-through sound quality, one surprising feature that bears mention is the microphone quality on phone calls or meetings.  Folks on the other end of the line tell me the sound matches or surpasses that of my old Sennheiser and current Bose headphones.  I tend to prefer boom mics, but apparently what's built into these earcups is better than I'd have expected, so on top of everything else it would be a good phone headset.COMFORT AND BUILD QUALITY:These are quite comfortable for value headphones.  Both the earcups and headband are well-padded, and the adjustment mechanism feels solid, with satisfying detents to make it easy to return to your preferred setting after, e.g.,  collapsing for storage.  The controls are also satisfying to use, with enough tactile feedback to ease operating by touch alone (more on this below).The earcup pads are covered with a soft vinyl-type material while the part of the headband sitting atop your head is fabric-covered.  Adjustment I think fabric earcup pads would have improved comfort, since the material covering the stock pads doesn't really breathe too well, though this would likely compromise the sound isolation a bit.  Going back to the Bose QC 45 as reference, its protein leather earcup pads breathe well enough that I've worn them on multi-hour plane flights without my ears getting uncomfortably warm.  You'll want to take occasional breaks from the JBUDS LUX.CONTROLS:The controls are easy to operate and do the job quite well.  The three control surfaces are:- a round button on top to cycle through ANC settings (ANC, aware/passthrough, off)- a rocker/toggle in the middle to handle volume (just click once in either direction to go up or down), track skip (push and hold to jump forward or back, though as with any such control the exact behavior will depend on the specific device or application), or cycling through EQ presets (press both sides of the toggle at once).- a round button at the bottom that handles power, BT pairing, call answer, and even summoning your Google/Siri assistant.  I got used to these quite quickly even with limited use.Like a lot of modern BT devices, the JBUDS LUX provides voice prompts for certain events like startup, shutdown, etc.  The voice is clear and easily understood, though I'd note the mild disappointment in its tone when saying  ""JLAB off"" is mildly amusing.One small thing worth mentioning is that the headphones not only report their level of charge to your paired device (if, e.g., your phone shows you this), but also announce the state of charge during power-up.  That voice info is really useful in my case, since the TV I'm using doesn't report battery level for connected BT devices.  I make special mention of this because the EB55BT, like some other JBL speakers and headphones I've owned, never reports battery level at all, just produces an annoying beep when the battery is ""low"" (whatever that is) that gets more frequent until you charge it back up (or the headphones just stop, I guess).VALUE/RATING:Something to consider in assessing the value of these is the price.  I got them on Prime Days for less than $50, but they're currently closer to $80, which is getting close to the ""on sale"" price of some better hardware.  That said, the price on the JBUDS LUX swings about quite a bit, so maybe put it in your shopping list and keep an eye out for buying opportunities.  For $50 this is a 5-star value, but the listed ""full"" price knocks this down to a four-star.",the United States,True,10,REVDZSF9MGEB8

These are GREAT!",5.0,meghan,2025-08-12,"I have really been enjoying these new headphones.  I got them due to the comfort of over the ear headphones and their ability to cancel out excess sound. I have ADHD and it can be difficult to focus on a task.  I find the headphones help with that,  especially at work where I work independently,  but with a lot of distraction.  It is also nice to have an OBVIOUS reason to be 'unavailable' for chit-chat. I can listen to podcasts and learn while I work. Win-win. They also help when my partner is snoring,  or watching a show I'm not interested in and don't want to listen to.I love them and I love the color.  I also love the price for the quality as well as the fast charge and that they hold the charge for a long time. They seem pretty durable when walking at a fast pace so I'm looking forward to their durability during a strenuous workout. They do fold up nicely for travel ease. Thank you!

Soft and fit very snug",5.0,Baylee,2025-08-07,"I got these because I am going to college in a few days and they seemed like the best option considering price point and functionality. As a college student I was looking for comfortable, noise canceling over the ear headphones. These are amazing!! The fit nice and snug, and super soft. The have great, and I mean great, noise cancellation and I love that you can adjust the sound to your liking. They also have different listening modes like noise cancellation, awareness, music, movie, and whatever you want basically. These are THE BEST headphones I’ve never had. Also allergies are kicking my butt right now don’t mind how I look",the United States,True,32,R1NHODX4W2RNDH

Needs slight adjustment, but good quality",4.0,RKats,2025-08-07,"They're pretty good! The noise cancellation is fairly strong, in my opinion. The sound quality was a bit tinny out of the box, but making modifications on the app helped a lot.",the United States,True,0,R3NJ2KIUNIUPWA

Not so noise canceling",2.0,Manuel,2025-08-07,"for the price they were they’re not that good. They sound like just basic headphones. They have noise canceling, but it only makes the noise when you turn the noise canceling on. It does kinda feel like it’s secluding your ears. I don’t know how to explain it but the noise counseling doesn’t work as it should. You could hear voices still and noises and the mic is not good. I catch myself having to turn the Bluetooth off in order to talk to someone. They’re not good for talking.",the United States,True,0,R2J94ENDO8YAAG

Great Low-Cost Option",5.0,watchdawg1,2025-08-07,"Great budget option if you're not into spending $300 for Bose, Beats or Sony. The sound quality across the spectrum is good, particularly if you're into bass. Well constructed, sturdy & nice looking.",the United States,True,0,R1K6JYXJA0I0HP
