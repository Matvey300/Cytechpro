FALSE ADVERTISING!!!",1.0,academygirl,2025-07-13,"I only bought them because the listing said that these had ""Extra Base"" in the TITLE of the listing. THERE is almost NO BASE at all.

Definitely can't do that with this design. This was definitely a regrettable purchase. Stick with the cheap JVCs.

EXCELLENT HEADPHONES, GOOD PRICE POINT.",5.0,Miss Jo,2025-06-26,"These phones are an excellent quality. I compared them to me Bose wireless and they compared very well when listening to lively organ music, in particular ""Emperor's Fanfare"" by Soler, played on the church organ in Santanyi Spain by Paul Fey. That combo is my gold standard for audio evaluations. The Bose had better bass response, of course, but these earphones didn't leave you wishing you had upgraded.

Best value and comfort for Web meetings",5.0,The Gadgetman,2025-06-22,"As someone who spends throughout the day in Web meetings, a comfortable and long lasting headphone is a must.  I've tried many, including earbuds and have come to appreciate this one. What I like:- Comfort:  When you sometimes spends hours in Web meetings, on-ear headphones becomes really painful.  Over-the-ear also shuts out outside sounds better than on-ear.- Wired: I don't have to worry about running out of charge like earbuds and wireless headphones.  The sound quality is also guaranteed to be consistent over wireless.- Inexpensive:  At this price-point, I can easily buy another one if it gets broken (usually from me stepping on them).- Sound quality: The meeting participants couldn't really differentiate the sound quality with likes of Bose.  NOTE: The results may be different when using for other than Web meetings where sound quality is critical.- 3.5mm Jack:  This is the gold standard for sound.  I've had USB-based headphones and had issues with the USB-driver. Fortunately, all 4 laptops I own (3 Lenovo Windows & Macbook Air M2) have 3.5mm port.- Brand:  Panasonic is not a fly-by-night and they're known to product quality products.",the United States,True,8

Fantastic for the price",5.0,Alex,2025-05-10,"To preface I bought these with my own money and am not sponsored in anyway, I’m just an audio nerd. These are almost exactly the same as the model that came with my mom’s cd player from the mid 80s. Only difference is the color and the ear pads hadn’t disintegrated. They sound the exact same too, which is to say surprisingly good. Mids and highs are clear, bass isn’t muddled and has good thump to it. They’re super light and comfortable. Cable is nice and has no noise from it so it has great insulation on it. Not much sound isolation but that’s kinda expected from on ear headphones.

Sounds amazing! But jack is too thick with phone case without modifying!",5.0,BM,2025-04-23,"The sound from this RP-HT21M blows my mind! I did not know these videos I'm watching have bass like this in them also high frequency clarity is crisp. Two things surprised me though. First is the 90 degree connection! May end up liking it but I expected a straight jack. Second! The jack will NOT fit your phone with a case on it! Too thick to be able to plug it in! Took a razor blade and cut a ring about 2mm off the black rubber around the jack and then grinded it carefully with a rotary tool for good measure to reduce the diameter to fit the hole in my phone case. ( as others show in reviews doing similar fix )I like the slim design you can lean back in bed against the pillow and it is not pushing on the headphones! Have not tried the microphone yet but I'm sure it will be ok! Again! Sounds amazing!!! Plugged in my old larger over the ear headphones for comparison right after listening with this one , the old one sounded like a telephone dropped in the bottom of a bucket! This thing is fantastic!",the United States,True,3

Disappointing Durability",2.0,Aryan Verma,2025-03-27,"I bought these Philips headphones a while back, hoping for a reliable pair since I’d heard good things about the brand.

After some time, they started giving off a ton of static noise whenever connected to any device, which made them unusable.

Long lasting headphones with amazing battery life and sound.",5.0,Rose,2025-08-20,"Had these headphones for 5-6 years until I had accidentally sat on them, causing one of the muffs to snap off. And even then, the headphones still worked! I just had to buy another pair because I couldn’t glue the muff back to the headband. But honestly, these headphones are so durable. They’re a steal given its amazing quality.Durability: You don’t need to store them in any headphones case. You can put it in your purse, backpack, or bag leave them lying anywhere without worrying about them breaking. Coming from someone who uses these headphones all the time and as a to go for my workouts, and even wearing them on rainy days. Exposure to sweat and moisture in general never affected its sound quality at all! They’re super comfortable and light to wear and I find them so much better than $100-$300+ headphones.Comfort/Battery life: You can wear them for hours comfortably. I only needed to charge them once or twice every two weeks, and I use them for 4-5 hours daily. You only need to charge them for like 15-20 minutes and you’re good to go. They last FOREVER.Design: I love that they’re light weight and simple, making them really comfortable to wear. Personal preference but prefer lighter/simple headphones designs than chunky headphones.Sound: Even though they’re not noise cancelling they pack powerful sound and pretty good bass. You can listen on full volume without worrying about damaging them.Had to write a review bc these headphones are a gem. You should absolutely buy these if you’re looking for high quality and long lasting headphones on a tight budget.",the United States,True,0

Good headphones with great charge. But the pink is actually purple!",5.0,gd,2025-08-09,"I don’t really care much about sound quality and I’m hardly a headphone aficionado, just needed something for those situations where you can’t blast stuff through your phone speakers.Design: They don’t go over the ear, and they’re not very sound canceling. I personally prefer it that way because I want to know what’s going on around me. They don’t make my head hurt like other headphones do when they’re on my head for a long time. They’re lightweight, but they feel a little like they’re easy to snap in half. I would definitely recommend getting a case for them for this reason. I would never throw these in a bag on their own, but I personally just travel with them around my neck. The ear parts have a very soft cushion and they swivel for easy storage in a case.Sound Quality: The sound is pretty clear, and the headphones come with an app where you can mess around with the settings/equalizer. Again, I don’t care much about that stuff so I didn’t get the app, but some people might like it. Also, these can get LOUD. Sometimes i just have them around my neck and use them as a speaker.Battery: That’s the star of the show for me. It’s crazy how long these last.One criticism is that I ordered the pink, which is actually a pastel purple in real life. Though that is of great importance to me because I love pink, it’s not enough to remove a star because this is inconsequential to most other people lol!Another thing is that they didn’t come with a case, which for the full price I’d expect at least a cheap little case for storage since they’re so lightweight and since they seem fragile. But I snagged these for damn near half off so I don’t care!",the United States,True,2

Be sure to install ONLY the Sony Headphones Connect app on iphone",5.0,Amazon Customer,2025-08-08,"The Sony Headphones Connect app has to be used to properly access the features.  Be sure that you access the Sony Headphones Connect app and NOT the phony headphones app that first appears in the iphone app store.  The Sony Headphones Connect app is absolutely free The phony headphone app will have a ""connect"" button on it that only leads you a screen where you have to subscribe for a fee.  Once the Sony Headphones Connect app is installed, it's a snap to connect to your iphone.The app has an  wonderful equalizer and other features that allows you to adjust the sound to where you want it.  It really is amazing. The 3D sound effect is just great. (The left/right sound balance is adjusted in an iphone via  Settings /Audio & Visual / scroll down to balance)This is a great product....",the United States,True,0

Work great, hurt my ears",3.0,Angel Nichole,2025-08-05,"Sound and quality is pretty good for the price. They’re lightweight and stay charged quite a while. The biggest issue is the round cups for the ear pieces. After a SHORT while, they hurt my ears because they’re not cupping the ears. They’re sitting on top of the ears and smooshing them. The cups need to be elongated or bigger to actually cup around the ears. Btw- I have small ears too, like child size and I tried them on my 9 year old and the cups were even too small for him.",the United States,True,0
