Big Sound, Short Comfort Window",3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Headphones deliver impressively clear sound and marathon battery life at a budget-friendly price. Lightweight and stylish, they‚Äôre a solid pick for casual listening. However, Bluetooth can be temperamental, slow to pair and occasionally prone to dropouts. Comfort is another trade-off: the on-ear design feels tight over time, especially for kids, making long listening sessions less than ideal.Basically, they sound great and last forever but for all-day wear or seamless connectivity, they fall a bit short.",Sunny R,True,0,the United States,"August 20, 2025"

Long lasting headphones with amazing battery life and sound.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had these headphones for 5-6 years until I had accidentally sat on them, causing one of the muffs to snap off. And even then, the headphones still worked! I just had to buy another pair because I couldn‚Äôt glue the muff back to the headband. But honestly, these headphones are so durable. They‚Äôre a steal given its amazing quality.Durability: You don‚Äôt need to store them in any headphones case. You can put it in your purse, backpack, or bag leave them lying anywhere without worrying about them breaking. Coming from someone who uses these headphones all the time and as a to go for my workouts, and even wearing them on rainy days. Exposure to sweat and moisture in general never affected its sound quality at all! They‚Äôre super comfortable and light to wear and I find them so much better than $100-$300+ headphones.Comfort/Battery life: You can wear them for hours comfortably. I only needed to charge them once or twice every two weeks, and I use them for 4-5 hours daily. You only need to charge them for like 15-20 minutes and you‚Äôre good to go. They last FOREVER.Design: I love that they‚Äôre light weight and simple, making them really comfortable to wear. Personal preference but prefer lighter/simple headphones designs than chunky headphones.Sound: Even though they‚Äôre not noise cancelling they pack powerful sound and pretty good bass. You can listen on full volume without worrying about damaging them.Had to write a review bc these headphones are a gem. You should absolutely buy these if you‚Äôre looking for high quality and long lasting headphones on a tight budget.",Rose,True,0,the United States,"August 20, 2025"

Great quality!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had these for 2 years now, and they still work just like new!

Another example of a company ruining a product with absurd automatic functions",2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these to replace a pair of BT510 that broke in my carry-on during a flight a few weeks ago. These were in sale, so figured I'd try the better model. I can't stand them. I think they sound a little worse than the cheaper 210s, but this is another product completely ruined by trying to decide for you what you want to do, and doing it, whether it's okay with you or not. They have some absurd feature where they automatically send a mute / pause command to any connected device if you so much as slightly light one side off your ear. Well first off that's just annoying in the first place, but even if I was into that kind of thing, they're so over-sensitive, that I've been using them for about a full week now, and not a single day has gone by that they havent shut off my music from me taking a sip of a drink, talking, or even just sitting absolutely still. SO frustrating. I'm going to buy another set of 210s because no way these are working on a flight with my head touching a headrest. To make matters worse, the first time I paired them to my phone, the driver asked permissions to link to my Google account?!?!? WHY?!?! I said no, and it did it anyway. Ita none of Googles business what headphones I'm wearing, and my email address and phone info darn sure isnt any of JBLs business. Only giving them 2 stars because the sound quality is half way decent when they dont stop your music. Oh, and the icing on the cake is the mute button functions as a hang up button on Teams, so yah, these hung up on a work conference call because I moved my mouth, and they sensed movement on my head and decided that means I want to hang up. Don't recommend these for any use, because they do what they want, and providing bare minimum basic function a set of speakers attached to your ears, is not one of those things! They're also extremely uncomfortable on my head compared to the 510s that are less than half the price.",MC,True,0,the United States,"August 12, 2025"

The only way I can hear someone is when they get right next to me and speak pretty loudly.Also the Be-Aware mode is incredible for looking busy while still being able to hear what's going on around you.
