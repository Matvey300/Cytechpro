Great while they lasted",3.0,JC,2025-09-14,"I have purchased these headphones several times. For a very modest price ($7.99) they have been great.  The reason for my repeated purchases is because I would give them to family or friends.  I'm very disappointed that my last purchase in May 2025 stopped working (right side) in September of 2025 - after only 5 months.  My Amazon return period is long past, however it seems the manufacturer should make this okay.  I looked into re-ordering, however the price has now doubled since the last time I made this purchase (tariffs?).",the United States,True,0,R16RCP1SG67IXT,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Very tight and uncomfortable, but okay sound quality",4.0,John,2025-09-11,"I was on the hunt for the best headphones for my hearing aid mic pack because I have to wear them for long periods of time and the headphones I had were uncomfortable. These are… also uncomfortable. They are quite tight to the ear and small so they push on the shell of the ear which is what I was trying to avoid from the last pair. Upside was that the sound was pretty good, but yeah, not for me. I gave them to my mom as she likes this style because it doesn’t fully cover the ear and she can use them while playing video games. They were cheap so I’m not torn up about it, but yeah, not for me. Also didn’t love the right angle jack because it takes up too much space on my hearing aid as the jack is in between the volume nob and the mic and it made the cord stick out in a weird way so it would not be easy to adjust the volume which is necessary for me.",the United States,True,0,R2D2TNO7FLCCBC,2025-09-19T14:50:57

They sound the exact same too, which is to say surprisingly good. Mids and highs are clear, bass isn’t muddled and has good thump to it. They’re super light and comfortable. Cable is nice and has no noise from it so it has great insulation on it. Not much sound isolation but that’s kinda expected from on ear headphones.

I did not know these videos I'm watching have bass like this in them also high frequency clarity is crisp. Two things surprised me though. First is the 90 degree connection! May end up liking it but I expected a straight jack. Second! The jack will NOT fit your phone with a case on it! Too thick to be able to plug it in! Took a razor blade and cut a ring about 2mm off the black rubber around the jack and then grinded it carefully with a rotary tool for good measure to reduce the diameter to fit the hole in my phone case. ( as others show in reviews doing similar fix )I like the slim design you can lean back in bed against the pillow and it is not pushing on the headphones! Have not tried the microphone yet but I'm sure it will be ok! Again! Sounds amazing!!!

Love the color n quality",5.0,lindsay,2025-09-13,"Love the color and sound and the ability to make multiple listening preferences.  Where I can change bass, tremble and whatever to my hearts desire and can switch between 1 or 2 of those or back to factory setting.  Also love the long batt life and comfort of wearing.  Really great quality for the price. Orginally I tried to find a cheaper  under $100 but good quality sounding product and came across cowin and got the E7. I  spent more then double for those, around $80 and they couldn't do any of that. Also they were nothing like advertised. The set I got was this ugly mismatched color of aqua blue and green . Which was nothing like the emerald green / solid one color I would get.  When I asked to return, they made me pay an add $11 return shipping and tracking, even though the product was nothing like advertised. Then tried to scam me out of my money by ghosting me after they recieved the return. Ended up having to contact bank and file a report after no response from them after 2 months of no response or reimbursement. Ended up finding these afterwards and I do not regret buying these.  I love them and the color which is my fave color. The price for quality is great.  I cant wait to also use these at the gym . I would def highly suggest these. Sony is a well known brand  with known quality products. Don't go thru the rabbit hole like I did try these out worse case you return or keep as a backup for gym. I personally wanted a set i wouldnt be too upset if they broke while using at the gym. This is that set and im in love. Plus AMAZON  is great when it comes to customer service.

Great Sound but with some issues",2.0,North Woods,2025-09-06,"These Sony headphones sound incredible, and they fit snug for immersive listening. However, that's where the positives end for me.The user experience is hampered by several design choices. The small power button is fiddly and difficult to locate by touch. The Bluetooth pairing function is integrated with the power button, meaning that holding it for slightly too long to initiate pairing can accidentally power the headphones off entirely, which is quite frustrating. Charging is also a step backward in modern convenience. While the headphones do feature a USB-C charging port, Sony bafflingly included a low-voltage, slow-charging USB-A to USB-C cable, instead of a modern USB-C to USB-C cable that would allow for faster charging and utilize current power bricks. They included a short, 6-inch cable which would not allow enough reach to charge while listening and multitasking on the phone.Crucially, these headphones have significant compatibility issues, even after extensive troubleshooting (I've tried all possible resets and re-pairings). While they work fine for basic audio playback from my Android phone, they consistently fail to connect to other devices like my iPad or TV, severely limiting their versatility. Most importantly for my needs, they are not compatible with my DJI Mic receiver for live audio monitoring during recording; they only work for audio playback after a recording is complete. This makes them unusable for my workflow.Despite their genuinely great sound, I cannot recommend these headphones if you need multi-device functionality, live audio monitoring capabilities, or expect the fast charging and modern conveniences that come with USB-C. They are simply too limited for anything beyond basic audio playback on a single device.",the United States,True,1,RCO5L2TJWSSA4,2025-09-19T14:50:57

I was immediately impressed with the quality materials used, not cheap brittle plastic and really good cables. They fit my huge head pretty well and I really like the cups rotating flat for storage. I might buy another pair for backup though I think these will be plenty durable. The sound quality is freaking impressive at all audio levels! Nice and clear. I’m hearing elements in my old music that I never noticed before, tracks mixed in that were too muddy for my ears to pick out before. Even though these things probably shouldn’t be able to knock out the lower bass tones, it does very well though if I really push it at higher volume for an extended period, the bass will start to crackle a little bit. It could be my cheap Pyle amp. It’s not really supposed to drive 24 ohm headphones.  Anyway, way to go Sony!",the United States,True,0,R16FY0XFEMC423,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Uncomfy...",2.0,Bee,2025-07-24,"I tried really hard to like these since I also own & like the JLab Lux ANC over ears, but they get uncomfortable after listening for over an hour 😭 I have average sized ears and they go over my ear just fine, but I'm not sure if it's how tight these headphones are but that + the muffs just make my ears hurt after having them on after the first few minutes. It's a bummer because they sound great (close to the over ears counterpart), and I know other folks have said they're comfy so maybe it's just a me thing. If you like on ear headphones then why not, try them out, but these were not a good fit for me. 😔",the United States,True,1,RH2WKP3CXTFPE,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Good Sounding Headphones Limited by Their On-Ear Form factor",4.0,Severian,2025-06-17,"Pros:* Comfortable* Well built* Battery length estimate from mfgr is accurate* Excellent app* Sound quality is well balanced, no dominant EQ range over any other* Controls are well placed and reliably functioning.CONS:* On ear headphones do not provide optimal noise cancellation. These are certainly better than nothing, but nowhere near as good as headphones with over ear cushions, like Jlabs own JLabs Lux (without the ""GO"" designation).* On ear headphones also do not seal the sound is as well as over ears, so if you like really deep bass, you are not going to find it here.* The headphone frame is a bit small, for my large hat sized head. I need to ratchet the arms out to maximum extension and even then, the fit is not optimal.Bottom Line:Some people don't like headphone cushions that cover the entire ear, due to the perception that such designs are hot and / or uncomfortable. If you are one of those folks - and you have a small or medium sized head - these are an excellent choice. The sound is well tuned, the app is really useful, the NC is adequate for medium demand use (subway OK, plane less so), and the headphones were built with excellent quality control. I would especially praise JLAB for not smothering the sound profile with sludgy inaccurate bass, a common failure with inexpensive / small brand headphones. These were tuned by someone that knows accurate sound and cares about providing such to a customer.If you want better sound, better NC, and have a bigger head (and don't mind over ear designs) you should spend a few dollars more and get the ""non-GO"" version of the JLab Lux, their over ear fitting model.",the United States,False,1,R2K1YD7XFF3A5Y,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Comfortable Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones",5.0,Hmo,2025-05-29,"Pairing this with my child’s MP3 player was seamless and very easy. She was giggling with how quickly we got that part figured out. The sound is extremely clear and not muffled. They definitely have the noise-cancelling feature that makes listening in a busy household so much more enjoyable. She really likes the texture and feeling of the ear pads– it is a soft foam with a kind of fabric over the top that is similar to a silky faux leather. I tried them on and agreed they are incredibly comfy on the ears. I wear glasses so that is a big deal with headphones pushing against my ears. The top of the headphones does sit kind of heavy on the top of my head, however. That might just be because I have a big head? It doesn’t bother my daughter at all.  But the ear comfort is fantastic for both of us.

Not the best for working out, but sound good",4.0,Dani,2025-05-02,"-Look great.  Very minimal and sleek. Matte mauve color is unique and stylish.-Comfy and pretty lightweight as far as over ear headphones go.  I am used to using in-ear headphones, so the over the ear versions are inherently heavier. I find that I can only wear these for a few hours before needing a break, but don't know that that would be different for any over ear versions. These have great padding on the ears.  I have a very big head so they have to stretch a bit, but fit well. I do find that they get a bit hot if using for a long time.-Sound good. Good base.  You lose a little something on the high notes/upper registers.  They can sound a bit tinny, not as round, but not bad, and that seems to be the case for all but the most expensive earphones. Overall I think they sound great.-The noise canceling feature works pretty well. You can still hear the world around you but it is muffled. I do find that I feel like I am in a tunnel with them on.  Feel like I can hear my own heartbeat in my head.  So took a little getting used to. Again, I don't like to use them like this for more than a few hours at a time.-Not my favorite for working out.  They tend to slip down into your face if you bend forward.  So I find that I am constantly readjusting them if I wear them while doing something very active.  Maybe this is just a fit issue for me? Not sure. These are best suited to seated work, light walking, or housework.",the United States,False,0,R14ARPNWFAY9E,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Excellent default sound signature. Comfortable on ear headband. Every feature I can think of.",5.0,lvron,2025-04-16,"JLab is a well-known brand for making excellent products. The Go Lux Headband is another one of those excellent products. I am not a fan of the ear covering headbands (I refer to them as earmuff headsets) unless needed for extreme noise cancelling. The go Lux headband does not completely cover the ear but rests upon it with a soft rubber-like, foam filled covering. These are very comfortable without contributing to the ""ear-claustrophobia"" (my made-up word) syndrome. My most used headsets are over-ear air conduction types. When I want to listen to Bass-forward music I'll use in-ear earbuds, and for sports, pool or workouts it's bone conduction. I wanted to try the Go Lux since it has almost every feature that can be offered on a headset and thought it would be comfortable as a sometime replacement for in-ear earbuds - and it is. The default sound signature is great but when in the mood for more Bass the app has a Bass boost pre-select option. For those who need even more Bass, the custom equalizer can do that. ANC works but is only moderately effective based on my testing. Still nice to have it. Spatial sound expands the sound stage. I keep Spatial sound on all the time. The Go Lux can get dangerously loud. The Safe Hearing feature is a must-have with this kind of volume capability. Playtime is rated at 70+ hours. After going through a lengthy period of heavy testing, I fully charged it and left it in the box unused for several weeks. I put them on to write this review and they connected immediately to my phone showing 100% power. Multi-point connections worked as expected. Call quality is very good for both parties. I reported on some of the most important features to me. I'll leave reading the complete list of features to the official product description. Considering the comfort, construction, sound quality and feature set, this is a good value 5-star headset.",the United States,False,0,R3JIPPUIMC9JCK,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Sounds Good, Feels Good — For A While",4.0,Elmer Cat,2025-04-13,"These headphones sound pretty good and the 3 modes of noise cancellation can make a big difference.  You can choose to cancel ambient noise, or in the ""be-aware"" mode actually amplify it.  The ear cushions are soft and comfortable, but are made from a non-breathable material which becomes less comfortable after being worn for a while.  The headband can be adjusted, but in its tightest setting still leaves the headphones somewhat loose such that they can slip down or fall off with running, biking, or other exercise. If you're just sitting down they fit good.  The current Amazon listing price of $50 represents a reasonable value for this item.",the United States,False,0,R2M8EZJSN4XURV,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Noise reduction, not noise canceling",3.0,Cari,2025-04-13,"The JLab Go Lux ANC Wireless Headphones are supposed to be noise canceling, but that is incorrect. It would be more correct to say noise reduction. I like the padding, but it does get warm after some time. Due to the way my ears are shaped, headphones work better for me than earbuds. I do wear glasses, so finding headphones that are comfortable with extended wear is hard to come by. These headphones are no exception. Maybe they are just too small for my head, but I don't think so. I have used these on a call, and it was a bit of a pain to get them working correctly. Once I did, the call went fine.

Good, but overpriced 🎧",3.0,Buisness clownS,2025-04-12,"I test headphones so you don't have too!🎧 I test tons of personal audio equipment. I put everything I review through the same tests for consistency. I use a Dolby EQ app and my phone because that's how I listen to my  music.Alot of what comes my way for review aren't familiar brands, but I know the name Jlab, and their gear tends to be hit or miss.  They're good, but not great. They are comfortable and seem well built and the button configuration is pretty standard so they're easy to use. The battery life is decent. The connectivity rage is ok. The volume range is just right, so you have room to crank them up a bit for that jam but he bass is lacking. The sound is and balanced, but maybe too balanced so the bass comes off a little weak. The ANC is decent for on ear phones. At this price point I've reviewed lots of lesser known on ear headphones that deliver better bass  a better connection range. So in the end for me, these are good, but not great. And honestly, they are a bit overpriced given what they lack.",the United States,False,2,R25CE2J5HG3PZ1,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Overall great pair, with some things to be aware of.",4.0,Sidney Tsai,2025-03-27,"I got this JLAB Go Lux ANC in Sage green, and while I think it's a great pair of headphones overall, there are some things to be aware of for its price. For what it is, it's great. The headphones by default are lacking in base, but perform well at midrange to tenor points. The Active noise cancelling is suprisingly impressive for being on-ear headphones. However, the ear cups are completely flat, which results in some difficulty when it comes to staying on your head. The material seems durable, but also hard to replace if broken. The software for android works incredibly seamlessly, and I'm satisfied. The color is difficult to pair with outfits, as the green is a very odd color.

Smooth Sound; Surprisingly Comfortable Fit; ANC Sort Of",4.0,Jackrbike,2025-03-23,"I’ve had these for a bit over a month now, to be sure I would not rely on first impressions.On-Ear vs. Over Ear—Everyone DiffersI use headphones for periods up to three hours at a time, sometimes four.  Inevitably I have felt a degree of discomfort on the ears when I’ve used on-ear headphones.  This discomfort never has been present with over the ear style.  I confess I got these knowing my previous experiences, but I was willing to try again, knowing JBL’s reputation for sound, the fact that ANC is touted for these, and the fact that I am entirely satisfied with a pair of JBL earbuds I do have that do not have ANC.The cushioning for these is very very good, and the on ear pressure from the headband is not bad at all.The sound is surprisingly good, and one can tailor the sound using an equalizer if one wishes.  Bass seemed to get somewhat better over time.  Perhaps that needed a break-in period.  Bass is smooth and certainly is not boomy.  Overall, though 25% of my earphone usage is musical, I’d say JBL did a good job on these headphones, considering the price.Push button control is good.  Sound feed thru for the pass sound through mode is satisfactory though not using that mode is also satisfactory.  However, I did find the ANC to be unimpressive, likely in part because these are, after all, on-ear headphones, which invite sound pass through, either way, by their very nature.  (I have a pair of $40 ear buds with ANC that is so good that I use them on airplanes.)Do I still prefer over-ear headphones?  Absolutely, but they can get warm over time; I can count on these to allow better air circulation when it is needed.

Fantastic customizability",5.0,Catharine M,2025-03-15,"-- Active Noise Cancellation --The ANC works well, but likely would be better with over-ear instead of on-ear cups. With that said, it does perform better than I expected. The intensity is customizable in the app; a fantastic feature especially for sensitive ears. Low ANC blocks some bass noise, while high ANC blocks a significant amount of bass noise, less mids, and minimal highs.-- Passive Noise Cancellation --PNC does not block a lot of sound, which I attribute to the on-ear form factor. The pads are comfortable, but I found that the tips of my ears started to hurt after a little bit.-- Fit and Comfort --As said above, the ear pads are pretty comfortable, but I had minor pain in my ears after a while. This may get better with time. Because these are on-ear, there isn't much holding them in place; I found that they were vulnerable to jostling. Not great for walking around during a commute, and I would be worried about them falling off if I were running to catch a bus. The build does feel nice and solid, though, so I wouldn't be too worried about wear and tear.-- Sound Quality --The sound quality is excellent, with booming bass and defined highs. You can customize the equalizer in the app to suit your taste.-- App --These are the most customizable headphones I've ever owned, and I love it. The ANC/PNC/Awareness cycle can be adjusted, if you wanted to remove awareness mode or ANC from the rotation when pressing the ANC button, for example. There is a good slider-based equalizer with three presets: JLab Signature, Balanced, Bass Boost. I prefer JLab Signature, which is the default. Like the ANC button, the other buttons' controls are customizable. You can set one, two, and three tap actions, and long presses of the volume buttons, and they can be set to switch EQ, last track, next track, volume up/down, noise control, google/siri. There is an option for spatial audio, which creates a cool directional audio effect. There is also a safe hearing mode, but it seems to be a straight volume decrease, not a limiter.",the United States,False,0,R1HIXA7T23QXAA,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Loud enough to cause ringing ears (but please don't go that far) and clear enough you can make out all the tiny nuances and even some of the more obscured instruments in your music. Just what I needed, so for once, Sony got it 95% right rather than their usual 60%. The one thing I don't like is the short cord. I have to plug it in at the front of my PC rather than to the sound card.

This is referring to the Sony MDR-ZX310AP ZX Series Wired with mic.The crazy ending to this review is that I also have the Sony MDR-ZX110 which looks very similar but comes without mic and it has the most amazing sound quality I have found in headphones under $100 (the MDR-ZX110 currently costs $9.99 on Amazon - 5 stars for sound quality - the comfort on the ears is the only knock on this one, probably not comfortable to wear for hours on end, but still the best sound quality headphones I have found under $100).",the United States,True,0,R25GI3KP88PVR0,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Long lasting functionality",5.0,Caitlyn,2024-08-20,"NOTE: The attached pictures are of my (six year old) pair.I bought an identical pair (same brand, color, etc) a few years back when I graduated high school. I really liked them and they are an affordable price, so I bought this pair for my sister.My pair has worked well all these years and still provides excellent sound quality. It has been almost six years and they are just now starting to wear. The ear cushions are tearing off and a tiny bit of the paint is beginning to chip - and this is after almost daily use for five and a half years and carrying them around in my backpack half the time. I personally don't mind the tearing as they still hold together well enough and I don't notice the tearing when wearing the headphones - the cushion itself is still good. The mic still works great and so does the sound functionality. I imagine they will last many more years to come.These headphones are adjustable and the ears are even labeled: ""R"" for ""Right ear""; ""L"" for ""Left ear"".",the United States,True,20,RMH87PR0Q9RA2,2025-09-19T14:50:57

After a while it began to hurt and made my ear sweat a little. I knew it was coming, it's like that with all these on-the-ear sets.. I mean that's why they call them ""ON the ear"", right?

Although these have clear sound and okay bass, it gets 3 stars but the volume is not great at all even at max.I honestly don't even listen to overly loud volume. In fact the ear buds from Sony, I rarely was able to put at max volume but these are absolutely dull. They don't wrap your ears too well so it less viable to reduce outside noise. It's flush against the ear. The volume reminds me of the cheap headphones from the 80's and 90's.",the United States,True,1,R3E0KW7ORV4F10,2025-09-19T14:50:57

But for those who only use headphones on the plane, especially for the noise canceling feature, this is for you.  I specifically looked for plug-in headphones because they are more comfortable than earbuds, and more reliable than bluetooth.  No, these are not Bose headphones, but hilariously, they rank second to Bose on many reviewers' lists!I bought these to replace my 15 year old Audio Technica headphones that still work but are falling apart.  I took both pairs with me on a recent trip and did a comparison.  I could not tell a difference between them, even though the Audio Technica ones covered my ears better.  When not watching movies I wore them just for the noise-cancelling feature, which worked just fine.  I am a relatively small woman so larger people might have a different experience with ear coverage.  These earphones fold up and become quite compact so they don't take up much room in your carry-on bag.  They fit neatly into small, semi-circular cases that are readily available on Amazon, and which  I highly recommend.  The nearly identical version of these headphones at about half the price does not have the noise canceling feature.

So lets be realistic about what you are getting. You are getting a pair of portable headphones that will REDUCE any surrounding noise to the point that whatever you are trying to listen to can be heard. They are not going to silence the surrounding noise, no open element headphone can. These are not the headphones I use when I am flying a plane, but they are the ones I use when I am flying commercially on a A320 and watching movies or listening to music. The battery life is very good, they fold up to reduce the amount of space they take up in your carry on, and they have a nice long cord .

Basically false advertising.",2.0,Amazon Customer,2025-01-04,"My sister got these for me for Christmas, knowing that i was looking for noise cancelling headphones so I wasn’t destroying my hearing. A big part of noise canceling headphones is that you don’t need to turn music up loud to hear since all outside noise is tuned out. Sony said on the box that it removes 95% of noise. That’s not true at all. I have to turn them up just as loud as my $10 wireless earbuds. The sound quality is okay but it removes maybe about 50% of ambient noise. Also, the sound quality is only good when turned up. These get quite dull and somewhat muddy at low volume which again makes them basically useless as advertised. They’re just cheap over ear headphones. That’s it. I’d be fine with them if they weren’t trying to claim 95% noise cancellation. Find something else. You also have to use a battery which is fun, I love listening to music only for the battery to die halfway through. They’re not rechargeable batteries either, it’s a physical battery. That’s just annoying in this day and age. I don’t want to spend a ton of money on batteries, we know they aren’t cheap anymore, and it makes so much additional waste.

They may not last forever and don't have remarkable sound quality, but if you are need a pinch and need something functional and comfortable for everyday use, these will get the job done for music, YouTube, etc.  I had no issues using these on my flight and fortunately are foldable so that they are easy to travel with.

Even found the perfect case to go with these on Amazon that was so cheap. The only thing I struggled with was that they started to hurt my ears (since they're not over the ear headphones) and the top of my head (no padding) after about 2 hours.  I've tried using them at Starbucks when working and same thing happens.  These are great for short-time use. I used them at the gym for 40-ish minutes and they were great!

Good, basic headphones (but noise cancelling does not work)",2.0,Peter E.,2024-01-07,"I've owned several pairs of the ""non"" noise-cancelling Sony MDR-ZX110 (which runs $10 - $15 on Amazon).  It's a good, basic headphone.  The noise-cancelling on the model being reviewed (the Sony MDR-ZX110NC) requires a battery (a non-rechargeable battery is provided) but does not work as used expect (it just boosts the bass and the volume).  Save $20 and get the ZX110 or find a different headphone that really has noise-cancelling.",the United States,True,0,R2XXNKKKWRAGYA,2025-09-19T14:50:57

I didn't know when I bought these that there was a built in microphone, but that has proven to be very handy as well for meetings. Lastly, they are very well made and comfortable.

Huge Drop In Quality- Don‘t Buy",1.0,Hilary,2025-08-04,"I first started buying these headphones a year or two ago when the first pair broke after a year of use. Not a big deal and they were only 30 dollars and lasted so long, so I bought another pair.  That had a sharp drop in quality and rise in price, resulting in them breaking in about 4 months. For some foolish reason, I bought another pair for now $50. These ones barely lasted two weeks before snapping. I‘m not rough with my headphones, I don’t take them on rocket ships or beat them with hammers- they stay on my head or by my desk and somehow manage to snap themselves as i leaned against the wall. Seriously, how do headphones snap from leaning gently against a wall? I‘m a little teenage girl, not a body builder or the type to slam my head against walls.

Immediately impressive.",5.0,Fatt Matt,2025-09-06,"Sound- 8/10Not perfect yet soooo good especially considering the price point. A little bit more noticable idle noise than more expensive headphones. Heavy on the bass and lacks sparkle by default. Get the Soundcore app, you can balance it out nicely with a custom EQ, or the ""Lounge"" preset does a pretty good job. But even without custom settings, you simply can't beat these for 20 bucks. Especially if you like to hear the full spectrum of bass, straight down to 20hz. These can go very loud as well.Fit/Comfort - 8/10Depending on how you set them on your ears can impact the perceieved sound, this is just a general disadvantage of on ear headphones. These clamp down comfortably and do a great job blocking out backround noise passively. They're pretty lightweight so easy to walk around with.

Headband cushion peeled, but great product other than that.",4.0,Elise Melinn,2025-07-16,"Still great sound quality after probably a year at this point of continuous use(besides charging and off time). Unlike other brands of headphones the ear cushions are still fine. The headband cushion on the other hand isn't. I've had to tape it up because the cushion cover was peeling away from the cushion. Probably means it's time to replace the cushion, but I'm not an expert on how to replace headphone cushions of any kind so...small duck tape roll it is until the sound or connectivity goes. Love the way it folds for travel, means I can fit it in my purse well. Also appreciate the L and R on the inside of the ear cushions area. Much more visible than other brands that have it above the ear cushions on the inside band of the headphones.

Way better than most, more expensive headphones 100%",5.0,Whitney,2025-07-13,"I got these during Prime Day for $20 and I am so impressed. Even at the regular price, Souncore H30i will by far exceed any expectations.I bought JBL 520 headphones and returned them because they weren’t very loud, the bass wasn’t what I was looking for, and the ear cups came off way too easily. Then I bought these to check out instead the following day. The difference is honestly insane. Soundcore H30i are surprisingly loud, as in loud enough that turned all the way up hurts your ears almost, and the bass is heavy. It doesn’t even matter for me that they aren’t noise canceling because I couldn’t hear anyone when they tried to talk to me today at work when I was blasting EDM and cleaning. They seem to be pretty sturdy and a plenty comfortable fit for my head. My job is physical and I’m moving up and down a lot, they didn’t slide off at all which was wonderful. I’m definitely happy about this purchase!I also appreciate soundcore for having fast charging headphones throughout, I don’t think I’ve ever had a pair die on me before I got them to a charger!

Two different pairs broke the exact same way.",1.0,InhabitsOldCar,2025-01-14,"UPDATE: Anker very generously offered to send me a new set of these headphones, which I accepted, in hopes that the “third time’s a charm” rule would ring true! I definitely respect Anker for their efforts to make things right by their customers.Unfortunately, eventually the new headphones met the same end, snapping at the same weak spot at the joint between the band and earpiece, despite that I was EXTRA careful with them this time because of my past experiences.Anker puts out some great products—I own several—this just doesn’t happen to be one of them.————-I loved these headphones - great sound quality for the price, comfortable, understated aesthetics; these headphones checked all the right boxes for me. That is, until they broke at the thin joint between the band and the earpiece.I take very good care of my headphones, even the crappy-quality ones I just like for their unique looks. And I definitely took care of these Soundcores. So when they snapped at the joint, I figured maybe I got a flawed set, and didn’t think twice about purchasing a replacement.Sadly, the second pair snapped at the very same joint.Needless to say I won’t be purchasing a third pair, nor can I recommend anyone else do so. They’ll only make you love them, then turn around and break your heart.",the United States,True,9,R239T1RAKFH794,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Comfortable, quality sound, great bluetooth",5.0,craig of course,2024-12-08,"I bought the h10 (holiday sale $22) to use with a 9 band equalizer. I'm not yet willing or ready for hearing aids! I used an optical splitter (BlueRigger Toslink digital optical audio splitter adapter around $8). Connect splitter to TV optical output and one port goes to soundbar and other port to the digital to analog decoder which ill describe  in a minute. I can now hear 2KHz and above thx to the equalizer (behringer mini fbq800 from Sweetwater.com around $70). BTW, I have Bose OVER the ear ANC ($$$$) but wanted simple ON the ears and h10 is perfect ($). My wife likes the sound very low from the soundbar and I can now turn up the headphones volume to add many more years to a happy marriage. As for gear, connect TV optical to OREI DA34 digital to analog decoder audio converter (this unit processes the all-important Dolby signal and PCM) around $30. Connect the DA34 to the equalizer. In order to provide Bluetooth, output the equalizer to a wireless Bluetooth transmitter. I use the MEE audio Connect around $20. Turn on TV, equalizer, put h10 into pairing mode (press button for 5 sec) and press MEE button. Voila. Yes, there is a very slight audio latency with Bluetooth in the headphones, but the soundbar volume is low and the earphones is a bit higher so it is not distracting for me. If the soundbar is off, it's all moot.",the United States,True,0,RIN5YCAJBQ7SZ,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Fantastic Portable headphones.",5.0,Devin D. Bass,2024-11-20,These are great portable headphones they fold nicely and store easily in your backpack. I recommend you buy a hard shell case to protect these headphones.  They hold a charge for a long time I would say about12 to 14 hours.  The sound quality is excellent the bass is very strong and crystal clear.  I don't think they are marketed as noise cancelling but when I am wearing them I don't hear much from the outside.  They have a strong fit very snug. I think If you have a Large head these might be too tight.  These are great sounding affordable headphones.

Done With Buds Forever, Incredible Value",5.0,D. Glassner,2024-10-18,"I collect headphones, or as some might say, I'm a headphone hobbyist. In my collection are HiFiMan, Sennheiser, and AKG high-end headphones. I always used a set of buds for knocking around, walking the dog, and talking on the phone. My last two pairs were from Soundcore, including Liberty Pro 3s which I paid over $100 for. They were okay, but despite trying many different tips, they would fall out of my ear, not provide a good seal, I'd accidentally hang-up on folks by pushing a bud back into my ear or eventually get clogged with earwax.This time when it came time to replace my buds I thought I'd try something different. Despite my bad experiences with buds, I've always appreciated the value, sound, and features of Soundcore products. Because I have no use for gimmicks like noise-canceling, etc., I looked through the line-up to see which set of Soundcore cans had none of those useless (to me) features and found these for $25-ish.As far as price-to-quality ratio, these are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. The microphone is stellar (it sounds as good as most podcasts I listen to, even better than some), the sound for listening to calls or podcasts is great, and to my surprise, music sounds better than virtually any bud I've ever owned. And even music sounds great, which was not even my main usage for these. Do they have as flat and detailed of a response as my best, open-back headphones...? Of course not. They have a bit of boost in the bass, like many less expensive earphones. However, even this can be adjusted with the EQ in the free SoundCore app.Much to my surprise, given that they don't even cover the entire ear, wearing them even without anything playing seems to block out about 85% of outside noise. I will say, they fit very snugly, some might even say tight. My head must be on the smaller side, because I rarely have to extend headphones beyond the smallest size, and still they are VERY snug. I doesn't bother me, but they might become uncomfortable after an hour or two. However, I don't use these for long listening sessions... I have many, much better wired headphones for that.These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever had, including my first pair ever, my now long-gone $300 Sony MDR-1R. For $25! For that money, I was expecting something with good utility for my purposes. What I got was a really fun pair of cans.",the United States,True,28,R3DIOPSYV8ISPY,2025-09-19T14:50:57

The H30i has an awesome battery life that's taken me multiple days to totally run through. The microphone quality is great for phone calls and I never have issues with clarity. Audio quality is great, bass is great. The buttons are just what you need and nothing unnecessary yet give a satisfying and responsive click. The H30i's USB-C port is great and let's you get rid of your outdated USB Micro-B cables. The earcups have the ability to swivel and spin together with an adjustable band for improved comfort. The design is professional yet elegant. The H30i even supports a headphone jack. Unfortunately, the H30i's internal microphone does not work while wired, but you can buy an aux cable with an inline microphone to use the H30i as a proper headset even while wired.

The only missing component is another microphone (to block out background noise while on calls), and noise canceling. But I know what I bought, so that's not a fault of the product. Liked so much I bought another set.I will add that the oblong shape of the headband does cause some ear discomfort after wearing for a while, since they don't sit ""flat"" as much as the swivels help align them on the ear. Maybe it's just my head shape or ear placement, but a similar set from another brand doesnt have this problem since the headband is more rounded.",the United States,True,2,RTMR4Z26GZC39,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Won’t generate QR code like typical prime returns allow.  I wasted $22, not at all pleased with product or returnability.  When it says Free Returns be aware there is no QR scan code available, must take to UPS preboxed and labeled (need printer to do that) or pay $7.99 to UPS for label.  This should be conveyed before purchase.  Saying free prime returns is misleading when the typical return just needs a QR code, not everyone has a printer.

Obnoxious Interference",4.0,Marilynn B,2023-08-30,"Usually, I prefer to use wireless ear buds, but I use them for hours a day and was getting frustrated when needing to take them out to charge. As an alternative, I looked at over the ear wired headphones that connected with a c-type USB, but I definitely didn't want to spend more than $30 on a pair since they'd be my in-between while my buds charge, so here we are with the Kensington headphones. Overall, they are very good - sound quality is great, and despite the ear coverage not being a tight seal, enough ambient noise is blocked so that I can enjoy the music, but not so blocked that I can't hear important background noises (doorbell, kids screaming, etc.). They are comfortable on my ears and on my head, which hasn't been my experience in the pas with headphones. That said, there is random and often obnoxious interference that comes through, and I can't pinpoint if maybe it's something with my phone or some kind of external interference from a computer or something like that, but it does seem that no matter where I set my phone, the interference happens. If you've ever used dial-up internet, you will remember the unique tapping that would emit through computer speakers just before the phone rang, and that is not only the type of interference, but has many times been the exact sound I get. All-in-all, even with that interference, these are good headphones.",the United States,True,6,R27SK5AFDETXIH,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Inexpensive, but not ""cheap""",5.0,Mark M,2025-08-27,"These headphones are inexpensive, but they are not ""cheap"". I remember my much more expensive headphones from the 1970s, and these are head and shoulders above those, at a fraction of the price. When I want crazy sound, and bass that backs out my fillings, I turn to my Sennheisers; but for working all day at my computer, these couldn't be better.

It is the single most frustrating thing I have to deal with on a daily basis. Sometimes when they shut off they'll go into automatic pairing mode when I turn them back on, so that's another fun little quirk with these pieces of garbage.

Not suitable for my needs as a constant user.",3.0,Kat,2025-05-01,"I’m a nearly 24/7 headphones wearer so have a lot of important criteria. My current daily drivers are the skullcandy uproar wireless, which have been frustratingly discontinued, so… the search begins. First and foremost, my headphones need to be comfortable and they can not make me overheat. These were both a little uncomfortable, and already made me feel too warm within just a few minutes of wear. I specifically gave these a chance because another reviewer said they didn’t cause overheating, but this was not the case for me. A lot of the discomfort was from the tightness of the band, which will loosen over time so I’m willing to forgive it, but the ear cups—while decently soft and squishy—seemed to reflect my own body heat back at me and amplify it. This would make them unwearable for even an hour, let alone a full day. I will say that I appreciated the design of how the band is adjusted, because they adjust higher up, meaning it gives both a little more width and a little more length than other, similar designs. Many headphones continue to squeeze your ears tight to the side of your face no matter how long the extension is, but the additional widening helped enough that I can see how they’d be very comfortable with some wearing in.These sound excellent, which I’ve come to expect from Skullcandy. The sound is clear and un-muffled, and does not feel lacking. I don’t really know the differences in sound descriptions and words, but skullcandy has always sounded very, very good to me when it comes to listening to every kind of media I can think of.The buttons are too small to quickly find when you need to pause or adjust the volume, and I pause my sound a significantly high number of times per day, so this would be a problem. I could add dots of puffy paint to them if I wanted to make them more prominent, but I’d already decided these weren’t keepers. They’re also grouped really closely together and feel sort of “mushy” when you press them, which makes the physical act of doing so a bit difficult if your fingertips are hyperflexible. The absolute distaste I have for these buttons was a HUGE part of rejecting the headphones overall, as well as the fact there seems to be a bit of a delay when you press play/pause to when it actually activates. So on top of pressing the button being a slow event, the action itself is slowed, as well. No thanks.All in all, these are not the WORST headphones I’ve ever tried, but I decided in less than an hour they weren’t worth a hoot at all for me.If you’re also a nonstop headphones user, I’d recommend finding something else for your daily driver.",the United States,True,0,R1YCAW47CDQXAE,2025-09-19T14:50:57

That lead me to one of my negatives. The fabric that encloses the earpieces is very flimsy and I can see these fraying or tearing very easily. Another drawback is the chord. It is short and it is fixed to the headphones so there is no replacing it with a longer chord.Even with the negatives, I found these headphones to be a great value for the price and am very happy with the quality of sound they put out",the United States,True,3,R2E34EWRUJ9V7I,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Usually, these things start mashing and pinching my ears after a bit, but I’ve worn these for a few hours at a time with no problem. Soft pads, lightweight build, just a good fit.Bonus points for the inline controls sticking to the industry standard format instead of doing something ""new and improved.""

I didn't expect such a mature sound from these plastic low-cost headphones.The build and fit, however, leave a little to be desired. I don't mind the on-ear design, but the way this headband is shaped (circular instead of slightly oval/oblong) means the sides of the headphones stand out quite a bit from the sides of your head.

The included in-line microphone and controls work well, and can be used for calls if needed. The sound has a great range! With some of my guitar rock, hip hop, edm playlists they produced great low bass and clean high end for clarity in audio.

Great for bass lovers",5.0,Dagger,2025-05-08,"I always appreciate the fidelity of decent wired headphones over those with Bluetooth connections. These didn't disappoint, with a few qualifications.I compared them to a few other major brand on-ear wired headphones and these definitely had the best bass response and a good clean sound.Bass was strong and clean, definitely the main feature of these headphones, and a great reason to get them if you like powerful bass. But in all three EQ settings I found the mids and treble to be a bit weak compared to the other headphones I compared these to. Although weak in my opinion, the sound across all frequency ranges was very clean... much better than lower quality headphones.The microphone placement on the control module allows for good clean voice pickup (better than microphones located on headphone cups or earbuds). It does a good job masking the sound of the cable rubbing on your shirt (which some others don't).They don't come with any documentation, so here are a few tips. To toggle the EQ among bass-favoring, voice-favoring, or default, you need to hold down the volume ( + and - ) buttons simultaneously for 2 seconds. The setting will be announced as it switches. Tap the center button to pause/play, hold it briefly to activate voice commands (like Siri).These headphones fold flat for storage and the headband is adjustable, but they lack horizontal pivots on the earcups, so depending on your head shape they may press harder on the bottoms or tops of your ears. I didn't find this to be a big deal and they were comfortable enough on my big head.Overall, these are great sounding for the price, and if you're a bass lover you'll really enjoy them.",the United States,False,2,RQE5KDKCIQ5SA,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Porta pros on a budget",5.0,Ian Podbielski,2025-05-21,"If you are looking for audio on a budget these little guys are hard to pass on. The Flats nearest competitor are the classic Koss Porta Pros. Both provide fantastic sound at great prices, but differ in two big ways. Firstly the JVCs cost 1/3 to 1/4 of a pair of Pros(which honestly makes them so hard to pass on) and secondly the sound. The Flats really live up to their name and have a great flat tone across genres vs the Pros. If you don't want to shell out the extra 20-30 for a warmer tone buy them and regret nothing. As a side note on durability you could probably break a pair of Porta Pros with a pair of Flats.

Shouldn't sound or feel this good for $13 ( PortaPro alternative )",5.0,Doug B,2025-04-09,"I bought these along with the somewhat coveted JLabs Rewind ( gen 2 ) Bluetooth headphones. I bought both because I've been looking for something that won't cause me physical ear fatigue or hurt immediately upon wearing.I REALLY wanted to love the JLabs because they offer something that the JVC Flats cannot.... No wires.  I LOATHE wires.That said. I will take the cables on these JVC Flats ANY day of the week because of what they offer over the JLabs Rewind.  Before I state what that is exactly, let me just say that the JLabs are about as comfortable as the JVC Flats.  Maybe more... But not quite,  without modifications.  I'll explain, because it's relevant.I have small ears.  And small ear canals. This is why I can't wear in-ear buds for too long, and is also why certain headphones hurt my ears or skull, depending upon how where and how they sit on my head and ears. It's a freaking curse.I started looking for headphones where one of the main selling points is being lightweight and comfortable.  Both these JVC'S and JLabs seemed to fit the bill when looking at their descriptions and reviews.  So, I bought both.I went into buying the JVC Flats knowing there was no mic or volume control, which I am actually fine with.  So I won't ding ding a star for it.What I wasn't expecting from the JVC Flats though.... Was how freaking good the sound quality would be! I have had several pairs of JVC marshmallow in ears, and now that I think about it, those sounded great, and are like fifteen bucks, so... Maybe I shouldn't be surprised?I should not that I also primarily wanted these for podcasts.  But when I heard the JVC Flats, I put on some music and was kind of floored.They instantly reminded me of Koss PortaPros, but with a tad more forward low and mid bass, maybe?  I used the PortaPros A LOT in my 20s and 30s and am now 53, so I've lost frequency range throughout the years.And they're LOUD! I don't need them to be this loud, but this is a terrible issue with the JLabs Rewind.  They're incredibly low.  Maybe lower voltage to increase battery life, but it's horrible.I'd have to put the volume to about 85% on the JLabs for basic, comfortable listening levels, whereas with these JVC'S, it's about 40% or less.  Fantastic.  And again, loud means nothing if it's loud and garbage.  These are loud and clear with no real bass mushiness even at uncomfortably loud levels.  Crystal clear.  Awesome.They fit snug on my ears, and the ear pads are cushy and fairly soft.  The outer layer is that faux leather material that always seems to eventually tear on headphones, so we'll see on that one....My only wish is that the actual driver housing was a TAD wider because while the driver seems to be positioned perfectly against my ear canal, the housing edges kind of hit the edges of my ear, causing some minor discomfort.Someone with normal, non-freakishly small ears, (which is most people), won't be bothered by this I guess.  What else. The head band, even though it has no padding, is barely noticeable.  Likely due to how light the frame is.  The band adjustment gives you a really pleasing tactile single groove click when adjusting.  Nice touch.I might give the JLabs a slight win in comfort, but ONLY if changing the foam pads on them, to something more foamy/cushy and soft.  As they are, the JLabs driver housing is very rigid and  my ears really feel that.  If I kept them, I'd modify them with some extra foam.  Otherwise, they're lighter than the JVC 's with a smaller earpiece frame.I might actually try to modify these JVC ear ups to make them wider.  I'll likely also buy a few spare sets because this pair is a gem.Great job JVC.If there's one negative thing I can say about them, it's that they're not being made with USB-C instead of just the 3.5mm input plug.  I hate having to use dongles.  I already had one, but I hate cables as it is, so....Anyway, if you're cool with cables, don't have freak ears, and want something super comfortable and want very good sound quality at a STEAL of a price...( Get a few now before the tariffs double their price), GET THESE!P.S.PortaPros are more detailed and have better soundstage.  But for $13 bucks, these are the ONES to beat.",the United States,True,12,R3954R1G6MF1ZJ,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Excellent sound but they break too easy!",3.0,Natja K.,2025-03-29,"These really do have excellent sound, far better than you might imagine for the price. The bad news is they break really easy and I've been through several pairs. As long as you're very gentle with them they should last a while. The main culprit is right where the ear cup connects to the headband and that's pretty much where they all broke. The actual headband is it's very durable. Also the cable that leads from it is very thin so you have to be gentle with that too. They really do sound phenomenal but JVC should do something about it's durability because I've been through five pairs of these over the years and they all broke in the same exact place. One or the other ear cup breaks off work connects. My current pair I just glued it back on with super glue and made sure it was angled right to fit on my ear properly.",the United States,True,6,R2ZFFOH0QQLNNR,2025-09-19T14:50:57

I took them out of storage to provide TV audio while my spouse sleeps. And they still work. As hoped. These are not the right choice for adult critical music listening sessions. But they do offer surprisingly satifying sound during long sessions like binge watching or podcast listening. They're lightweight so I barely notice them on ears or bald head. When music appears in a soundtrack or guest appearance, they often impress me with how restrained but noticeable the bass is-- again these are not appropriate for critical listening-- but great for the purposes I'm using this for. I've just added this to my list because sooner or later these will give out. But I figured while I'm in Amazon, I owed others the benefit of my experience.

The sound is pretty impressive, and they are so lightweight and comfortable I can happily wear them for hours. I highly recommend.",the United States,True,2,RG7740XFDBGQX,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Incredibly Underrated Cans",4.0,Jennifer Click,2024-10-31,"If you are looking for one of the best kept secrets in headphones for both audiophiles and general listeners? Here she is, the Flats. Been around for many years, this has been a staple for me in my headphone journey. I’ve used a couple pairs on/off from 2012-as I write.With that said, the Flats aren’t for all. Let’s get that out of way! Big bass lovers, you look elsewhere. Need really great isolation, nah you can hear babies crying with these. Want a modern, sleek look? These have been around long enough to be retro now and kind of look it!That said, the sound and comfort are punching well above the price and looks would suggest. These cans provide a sound I would describe as: well balanced, mostly smooth but some sparkle in the treble. Clarity is slightly above average thanks to air and the treble crispness. Mid range feels a tad recessed but timbre is natural. Out of box they might sound somewhat metallic, let them play for several hours. That should go away. Bass, good punch, mostly a mid bass type of sound. Somewhat thick sounds but not rumbly or dark. A subtle V shape sounding headphone, which pleases most listeners.The comfort is top shelf. Due to their minimal design and weight, all cheap does help some things; I  can wear these hours and no fatigue. Cushions on the ear are just decent but keeps a loose seal to keep sound rich. But they rest on ear and are about the size of an average ear. So you should feel comfy and ears not too hot!At 12$, you are getting a killer value in headphones. Simple, basically timeless sound and design, and easy on the wallet?! It’s an easy recommendation! Remember, it’s not for those wanting Dre bass. It’s a balanced and clean set of cans. It will suit most genres other than those demanding pumping bass. Rock, metal, pop, mainstream, country; they all sound so crisp. Pick the color you like, and enjoy. The Royale blue color, it really pops in person.",the United States,True,3,R869FAMNXQOY6,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Very Robust",5.0,cici,2024-10-21,"I have had these JVC headphones for a year. I wear them running 30 to 35 miles a week in rain, sun, heat, and cold. I also wear them when doing work around the yard and construction work. Needless to say, I have snagged the cord many times to the point I thought I would have pulled it either out of the phones or even broken it. However all is still operating fine. I like wearing external phones so I can move them either onto or farther off of my ears to regulate volume and adjust for need to hear traffic. When directly over my ears the fidelity is very good for music considering my need for light-weight comfort while running or working. Considering all the use and abuse these phones have been through, I give them an A+ rating.",the United States,True,1,R297FG4Z42AFGN,2025-09-19T14:50:57

The savings aren't worth it",1.0,Rena,2024-09-01,"While I've been a loyal customer to Philips for a long time and usually satisfied, this time they've let me down. Sound quality is a steep downgrade from comparably priced headsets to such a degree that they fall into a lower tier entirely. Connectivity is unreliable and often requires multiple disconnects and reconnects just to work properly. Headphones will say ""device connected"" without actually being so. Worst of the lot though is the battery life. With a prior, similarly-priced headset I was able to go up to a week on a charge while this one can't get through the day. The battery life is only functionally 75% of the listed capacity, as every 90 seconds the headphones will interrupt your audio to repeat a ""BATTERY LOW"" voice warning. There is no way to turn this off and it will interrupt a single song two to three times, while the meter will show you having up to a quarter of your battery life left. The device can still be in the green on a battery meter and still will not function without being charged, in the most infuriating way imaginable. Budgeting in an extra $20 and going for a different brand will pay off to spare the frustration alone.",the United States,True,9,R2MIVKOAMW0EDM,2025-09-19T14:50:57

It's great for me. I didn't need full nose cancellation as I mainly use them in the office so its cancels enough for me to zone out & work without distraction but still hear if my name is called. It's comfortable on my ears and don't hurt even after wearing for over 9 hrs straight. It's easy to pause your media or skip to next track & to pair to your devices.

Another example of a company ruining a product with absurd automatic functions",2.0,MC,2025-08-12,"I bought these to replace a pair of BT510 that broke in my carry-on during a flight a few weeks ago. These were in sale, so figured I'd try the better model. I can't stand them. I think they sound a little worse than the cheaper 210s, but this is another product completely ruined by trying to decide for you what you want to do, and doing it, whether it's okay with you or not. They have some absurd feature where they automatically send a mute / pause command to any connected device if you so much as slightly light one side off your ear. Well first off that's just annoying in the first place, but even if I was into that kind of thing, they're so over-sensitive, that I've been using them for about a full week now, and not a single day has gone by that they havent shut off my music from me taking a sip of a drink, talking, or even just sitting absolutely still. SO frustrating. I'm going to buy another set of 210s because no way these are working on a flight with my head touching a headrest. To make matters worse, the first time I paired them to my phone, the driver asked permissions to link to my Google account?!?!? WHY?!?! I said no, and it did it anyway. Ita none of Googles business what headphones I'm wearing, and my email address and phone info darn sure isnt any of JBLs business. Only giving them 2 stars because the sound quality is half way decent when they dont stop your music. Oh, and the icing on the cake is the mute button functions as a hang up button on Teams, so yah, these hung up on a work conference call because I moved my mouth, and they sensed movement on my head and decided that means I want to hang up. Don't recommend these for any use, because they do what they want, and providing bare minimum basic function a set of speakers attached to your ears, is not one of those things! They're also extremely uncomfortable on my head compared to the 510s that are less than half the price.",the United States,True,0,RTU61ANQUBCIM,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Aprietan mucho son muy incómodos",2.0,Samuel Miguel Gonzalez Ramirez,2025-07-13,"Había leído algunas reseñas, pero como en otros casos, no me había pasado lo que decían… así que decidí ignorarlas, y fue un error. Es cierto lo que comentan: cuando estás viendo videos en YouTube u otras plataformas, el modo de detección de movimiento para pausar el audio se activa constantemente cada vez que volteas la cabeza, lo cual se vuelve muy molesto.Sin embargo, eso no es lo peor. Lo más incómodo es lo ajustados que son. Aprietan demasiado, y eso que no tengo la cabeza grande. Para quienes usamos lentes, la experiencia es aún peor: no los recomiendo en absoluto, ni siquiera si están en oferta, porque ahí es cuando se nota realmente lo incómodos que son.No soy audiófilo, así que doy mi opinión como usuario común. El sonido es aceptable, cumplen bien su función, y el micrófono se escucha decentemente.

You hear every detail.The noise canceling (*Noise Canceling*) surprised me — it blocks out outside noise without cutting off the music. It is perfect for use on public transportation or while working. You feel isolated, but still comfortable.*The battery is the star!* It lasts *over 40 hours* without needing to be charged. I have used it for days without a problem. And if you need it, it has *quick charge*: just 10 minutes of charging gives you 4 hours of music!The headphones are lightweight, don't press on your ears, and are comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The buttons are easy to use, and the Bluetooth connection is stable. The JBL app also allows you to adjust the sound to your liking.In short, if you want a quality headphone, with good battery life, excellent sound, and noise cancellation, the *JBL Live 460NC* is a good investment!",the United States,True,6,RTZGYXOVPGXRB,2025-09-19T14:50:57

if you are a avid music listener i wouldnt suggest",3.0,T. S.,2025-02-18,"So at first I really thought these headphones were great. I didn’t know it had a siri function but apparently it does and i low key think thats so useless maybe cause i dont use siri. But anyways, the buttons are pretty cool theres a weird switch on button to power it but it turns on within like a second. Im glad about that cause I hate it when it takes 5 years to turn on like the other 30$ jbl headphones. Also the sound is pretty good and its really noise canceling that was also a shock factor, I could barely hear people talking. Now onto its faults, Maybe because they are new headphones and you kinda have to break into them but they were tight on my ears/head like crazy. I got two massive headaches from it and i like to listen to music alot and for prolonged periods of time. Yeah its definetly not meant to be worn for a long time. Your ears get super sore too. Also a really annoying thing I hate is the fact that when you put them on a little tune plays and when you take them off a tune plays again and it shuts off your music. Got to be thee most unecesary feature jesus christ. Ill literally adjust the headphone on my head while listening to something and it will pause and for gods sake that tune does not have to play all the damn time! Sometimes ill wear it half off and it will pause the video and play THAT TUNE OMG. Okay let me calm down, other than the useless siri function, the tightness of the headphones ,and the automatic pause feature, id say they are okay. Ive had better headphones like i shouldve just stuck to sony but they legit wont connect to anything. Thats also a pro about these headphones, they connect to literally anything. It took me 3 months to get my sony headphones to connect to my laptop and i had to do that through charging it from my laptop. And I still never managed to connect it to my Ipad. These headphones managed to do that all within an instant like i didnt have to wait five years, they also connected to my schools laptops which again my sony COULD NOT DO!!! ugh",the United States,True,2,R33FQXG7WYDYYZ,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Great Quality, But Durability Could Be Better",4.0,ebony,2025-05-27,"Great Quality, But Durability Could Be BetterI bought these headphones for my 11-year-old to use with his school laptop, and overall, I was really happy with the purchase. They fit well, were comfortable to wear for long periods, and had good sound quality—perfect for schoolwork and occasional use at home.Unfortunately, they only lasted about half the school year. To be fair, my now 11-year-old can be pretty rough with his stuff. He didn’t use a case and often just tossed them into his backpack with books and other items. So while the durability wasn’t ideal, I still feel like the overall quality was solid for the price.In fact, I ended up purchasing another pair from the same brand to replace them. If your child is a bit more careful with their things, these headphones are a great choice!",the United States,True,2,RHTU389HDYJYT,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Smaller than you think",2.0,Emmy,2025-05-03,"I've been using JLab's GO Air Sport for years now and love them, but the in-ear buds get really uncomfortable for me during extended wear, so I'm looking for an alternative when I'm not active enough I have to use the earbuds, but these are just total garbage :(I saw several reviews that mentioned how small they are, but didn't think much of it because I *have* small ears for an adult, but these are so small the pads barely even *cover* my ears, much less go around them like this style of headphone is generally supposed to do. I only wore them for a few minutes and they were already getting uncomfortable.I've had cheaper headphones that sounded better, and were more comfortable than these, which is too bad.For pros? They're cheap and they did pair really easily, so I mean, if you're looking for cheap headphones (maybe for a child, because of the size) they'd probably be fine.I do also really like the physical buttons on the headphones themselves, most brands don't bother with those anymore. It's really too bad they're so uncomfortable/low sound quality :(",the United States,True,0,R1D7WQLZGDVN3R,2025-09-19T14:50:57

They fit nicely over my ears without crushing my lobes while I wear glasses. The audio jack fits in my cell phone and connects exactly as I needed.

This is a an impressively well built set of phones with solid adjustment from the u-shaped can adjusters---they stick out a bit but that is the way the are built---fit good on smaller heads.

Great Sound and Noise Cancelling, but Fit and Portability Need Improvement",3.0,cat lady,2025-09-10,"I purchased the JLab Lux ANC wireless headphones and have been impressed with the sound quality and the level of active noise cancelling.That said, there are two key issues that prevent this from being a 5-star product. First, the fit: the headphones are not snug enough and tend to slip off my head, even though I consider my head size to be average. This makes wearing them  with any kind of movement difficult.Second, the lack of a carrying case is a drawback. For a product at this price point, I would expect a travel case to protect the headphones, especially when tossing them into a backpack.If JLab addresses these two issues, improved fit and the inclusion of a case, I’d gladly upgrade this to a 5-star review.",the United States,True,1,R1MF44PTILVPFU,2025-09-19T14:50:57

They're the most comfortable things I've ever worn over my ears. I have had zero issues with them. I did drop them on the pavement a few months after I got them and I think it broke something loose on the inside, but they still work incredibly well.

SENSORY RELIEF",4.0,Rebugsy,2025-08-21,I have not used noise cancelling headphones before but after my confirmed Autism diagnosis I have realized much of what I thought was anxiety is actually sensory overwhelm. I decided to try these first to see if headphones are something that will help me before spending over $150 for the more recommended pairs.Upon just placing them on your head (not turning on) the sounds around me are already muffled. The moment I turned them on it was further improved and the holy-amazing-batman sound cancellation was clear the moment the noise cancelling turned on. Then when connected to my phone to play lofi music is the next best thing to being in a quiet room by myself. I have been wearing them for about twenty minutes and I already feel so relaxed whereas my child and mother are talking on the sofa next to me and only hear a light sound every couple minutes compared to the constant talking I would be hearing without that would slowly drive me to full blow irritation and aggravation. They have not started to bother my ears yet or give me a headache. Time will tell how they hold up and how long I can use them before getting uncomfortable.,the United States,True,2,R1FBWO0Q6NSDSZ,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Sound is great and easy to pair with devices. Noise cancellation is on par with my Sony's.  I do like they fold up for travel. My biggest complaint is they are a bit heavy and they creak when you move you head. So i wouldn't purchase if you are going to use these for running or working out. They also don't allow you plug in a headphone jack but i think that's common now a days.,the United States,True,0,R20TIMC66FGIYG,2025-09-19T14:50:57

Simple, affordable, and does the job for school use",5.0,Adri,2025-09-18,"I picked these up for my son because his school requested headphones for their learning system. Honestly, I chose them because of the low price, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how solid they are for under $10.The sound quality is clear enough for educational programs, videos, and even music. They’re not going to compete with high-end headphones, but they get loud enough without distorting and the voices come through sharp. The lightweight design is a big plus since my son can wear them for a while without complaining, and the padded earcups make them more comfortable than the typical budget options.Another thing I like is the fold-flat swivel design—it makes them easy to toss into a backpack without taking up a ton of space. The cord feels average (not super thick), but at this price point I wasn’t expecting premium build quality. So far, after a few weeks of use, they’ve held up fine to everyday school wear and tear.If you need a no-frills pair of wired headphones for school, travel, or as a backup, these are a great value. For less than the price of lunch, they do exactly what you need them to do.",the United States,True,0,R1W582913UFAXT,2025-09-19T16:25:24

Firstly I love my headphone. It doesn’t have noise cancellation, you might consider getting another type of sony headphones if you’re looking for that. The headphones don’t leak audio unless your volume is around 80-100 percent range. I used my head phones a whole week before it needed to be charged which means its battery life is good. The headphones use bluetooth connection and comes with a type c charger. The clarity on the headphone is great and the audio range is pretty good if you listen at extremely high or low volumes.",the United States,True,0,R1XBV4CHWTWS4B,2025-09-20T16:18:09

Great Value.  Good Sound.",5.0,K Teel,2025-09-18,"These are economy headphones, that, for the price, sound very good.  They have neodymium magnets in them, and that helps with the sharpness of the tone. They get a decent amount of bass. If you use a preamp or mixing board with them, you can dial in a very nice sound by adjusting the tone controls.  These are far better than earbuds. Of course you're not going to get the same sound that you'd get from a more expensive set of headphones (for this I'd recommend the economy Audio-Technica ATH-M20x Studio Headphones, or for more high end detail, the industry standard Sony MDR 7506 Headphones.) These headphones are useful for casual listening, or just using for monitoring to hear other tracks, while laying down new tracks. They also can be useful for checking your mixes or masters on something that represents consumer level listening devices. They come with both a 1/8"" and a 1/4"" stereo plugs. For the price of these, you can't go wrong. My last pair of equivalent headphones, I bought 20 years ago (they had ferrite magnets, so are more mellow sounding) and they are still working fine. Sony does a great job on these headphones. The one thing that they could improve on, with these new ones is: Lengthening the cord. It's pretty short. (My old Sony MDR-V250 headphones, came with a much longer cord. They are the predecessors to these new headphones.)",the United States,True,0,R3LGQKKCBT8J1U,2025-09-20T16:18:09

These headphones do not have a built-in mic (or perhaps user error?).What I do like about them is the color, fit, and battery life. It was also easy to connect to more than one device. They are also compact (fold) which makes that easier to travel with. The charging cord isn't overly log, but log enough since you are only using them for charging, as they are wireless.
