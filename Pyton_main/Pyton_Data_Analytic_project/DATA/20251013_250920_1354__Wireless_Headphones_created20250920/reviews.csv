They still work perfectly after a year of heavy usage.After buying headphones for over twenty years, I can unfortunately list off all the known weak spots with headphone designs.

Muffled sound quality",2.0,Isaac Davanzo,2025-07-19,"I purchased these coming from the Philips Audio Fidelio L2, which were excellent but falling apart after a few years.Frankly, I'm REALLY disappointed with the sound quality of these. I read in a lot of reviews that they were the successor to a similar series and had great clarity, but the moment I started listening to some music, I didn't like the sound at ALL. The bass swamps everything and there was basically zero clarity in the mids and trebles. Everything sounds like there's a blanket over it. I do a lot of composing and mixing, and these are the last headphones I would want to use when doing that. However, I do admit that the depth of the soundscape from the open-back headphones is nice. If I ignore everything sounding like its coming from a swamp, there's a nice depth to the staging.In terms of comfort and fit, they were awkward to try and seal on my head. The headband felt nice resting atop my head, but the earcups were large and didn't offer a comfortable seal. It felt like there was sound leaking out of the bottom and back of the earcups. Gently pressing the earcups to seal to my head actually exacerbates the bass-swamping issue. The build quality is fine. They look nice.I guess my Fidelio L2's are being dragged on a little longer till I find a different pair of headphones. Nothing a little glue can't fix.",the United States,True,0,R2B1D6NLNREOOB,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

5 For The Money, But With Fit Issues!",5.0,P. Law,2025-07-14,"5 Stars for the money, but they do have shortcomings!  I also have (mid-end, $200 to $300) Sennheiser, Audio Techica, and JVC, FULL SIZED COMPLETELY SURROUNDING THE EAR, CUP phones.  These have an EXTREMELY BALANCED SOUND (especially at the price point)!  The sound is my favorite, of all the brands I own.  I can listen for hours without fatigue!  The fit of these are fantastic for those of us with larger ears (save the weakness, later).  The construction seems very high quality, and appear to be very long lasting.  Now for the Achilles Heel!  If you aren't sitting upright, fairly passive at a desk, or comfortable chair, you will find the clamping force grossly lacking!  For me, bending my head forward, even the slightest bit, caused them to slip, to the point that the sound changed drastically.  Obviously, repositioning was frequently required.

Amazing sound",5.0,jonny2522590,2025-06-20,I'm happily shocked on how good these headphone's sound.I read someone else's review before buying these who go into greater understanding of the sound.I mostly buy planar magnetic headphones.All costing more than this 1.1 I believe is around 150 to around 170 without bluetooth.Another 1 I have was 300.Both sound awesome but l believe this 1 might have them beat on sound.I'm hearing more into music than l have before.Some songs the singer's words just are easier to hear than my other headphones.I use this with my s23 ultra and a no name USB Type C to 3.5mm Female Headphone Jack Adapter and a fiio a3 amp.Nothing fancy & I'm blown away.I haven't owned it long enough to talk about toughness  or longevity.,the United States,True,1,R32ZLMDG9LZM57,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Better than I thought they would be.",5.0,David O.,2025-05-23,"I figured Philips headphones would be very good and they are.The bass is deep and smooth, no distortion at sound levels that are borderline too loud. The bass drums sound like they are in the room with me and do not break up, even with some other strong bass signals. I was thinking of the kick drums which snap crackle and pop out of noncompliant drivers on lesser headphones, on the SHP9600 sounded as if they were right next to me. Noncompliant means the driver can't follow the electrical signal accurately. These headphones CAN comply.  Maybe a bit bright for me in the upper mids and treble but that is why we have adjustment allowance in our systems.These headphone make a surprisingly good sensation of spatial presence, not that sense of the sound coming through the tiny ear holes as others do. Probably comes from the excellent compliance of the 50mm drivers that bring subtle effects of reverb my $30 headphones can not reproduce. I felt like throwing the $30 headphones away but decided to use them for testing bad amplifiers, they are pretty bad.The ultra low distortion allowed me to listen to them for about four hours and had to break myself away from wowing at the sound quality. I did not waste my money on these Philips SHP9600 headphones.",the United States,True,2,R32SXO5DKSZRD0,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

There's just something awesome about these....",5.0,GOBLUE,2025-05-04,"I really love the SHP9600. For the current price (or price range in the last couple years), you would almost think that whoever is selling them, should be losing money (I can't say enough - the SHP9600 are worth MORE than what they are charging for it ) - the lowered regular price (sub $100) is like a give away...it truly is a much better headphone than what they are charging for it. Don't let the light weight, mostly plastic build fool you. They are more of a premium headphone than a budget headphone...you can't have everything at these prices. Note - although some may disagree, I do believe these headphones are worth the original price they had when they first came out. I think there was hesitance at first because some people thought the SHP9600 is ""DIFFERENT"" rather than an ""UPGRADE"" to the SHP9500 - NOT necessarily better - depending on your likes and dislikes. Some people seem to like one over the other - going in both directions (meaning some like the 9600 better, others sticking with the 9500 as better). So, the original price caused some people wait. However, once the price came down, its a no brainer. AND - I really do mean it's a no brainer - just buy them!  I personally love the added high bass frequencies in the 9600...it adds warmth. It also makes you feel like it has more bass all-round, even though it still has a major sub bass roll off and mid bass that dips below neutral. I do not think the added high bass muddies up the low mids  / mid-mids in any way. I also don't think it takes detail away...it just changes the main sound a bit. I also would never say it has any bass bloat...it just doesn't...besides, that roll-off is still there. The extra high bass helps to soften that roll off...it makes the set seem like there's actually some bass there. I know it won't help with the really deep lows, but it tricks you a little into thinking it has better overall bass - which is great for music. Don't misunderstand me either - these aren't bass heavy or bassy headphones in any way...(Not for Bass Heads!... - although you CAN eq some thump and bump into them...) At the same time - (another way of looking at it) - with that little bit of extra high bass, it makes them sound less cold and less clinical like other sets (ie SHP9500 or similar). Some say headphones that are more clinical (or even cold sounding) have better detail retrieval - but that's not necessarily the case...you just don't pick up certain things as easy because other sounds are more prominent - it doesn't automatically affect detail...or mean that detail isn't there. My main issue with cold sounding headphones is they aren't fun to listen too...not lively. Of course, you can always use an EQ, but it's nice to have a pleasant starting point. These SHP9600s have life in them...some livelyness without it being too much. A tad bit of color, without too much saturation. You can always adjust these with EQ. Anyone who says they have bloat or muddiness (if they exist) are wrong. Opinions are one thing, facts are another. I'm stating this as fact. I'm willing to argue that fact all day lol. It has an ""analog"" sound to me. I love that! Very soothing.  When you look at them compared to more expensive sets, they do still look nice (imo anyway). I love the open grill and gold ring around it. Maybe a little basic, but classy. Definitely a premium look imo.  These may be the most comfortable headphones I have. Light weight, not tight, nice feeling ear pads and headband. They are stretchable if you have a large head. I have others that are comfy, but not really any more comfy than the 9600. Build is decent too. I don't throw my headphones around like some people (I'm very cautious and careful with my sets - and they always last longer too!) Still, I feel like these will hold up. They aren't built like tanks though...so I'd be a little cautious. If you want a set to throw around - get a Beyerdynamic or V Moda...those are built like a tank (but you're gonna spend a lot more...and won't get the same type of sound...good or bad... just different sound profiles). Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about the build. I haven't had any issues. I think I did drop them once by mistake. Nothing happened.  If this is your price range, I staunchly recommend you get these. You can always ""upgrade"" later on (if you're chasing that perfect sound - like many of us headphone junkies and Audiophiles)... - OR - at least use these as a back up / secondary set. Really tho, if you like and get used to these, I'd bet you'll still use them - even if you get into the headphone collection game. My 9600s still get use. They never collect dust. Right now, they are connected to my PS5 controller (I use my AKG K702's for multiplayer games with ""footsteps""...or my Beyer 770s / 990s...but games like Horizon Forbidden West, I'll use these 9600s... especially if there is music involved). Sometimes I'll use the 9600s with my phone, or hooked up to one of my dac/amps. Anyway, I rotate them in and out of different useages. Since I'm talking up the 9600 right now, I may connect them to my main headphone ""Stack"" ---> SMSL DL100 DAC, connected to my Douk audio T8 Pro tube equalizer - via balanced xlr cables, which is then connected to my Douk audio H2 tube amp - via balanced xlr cables. This ""Stack"" is next to my chair in the bedroom - my main music listening station. I have 4 other music listening staions. I have a DAC/ amp connected to my PC in a different room. There's another listening station with separate DAC (w/ Bluetooth receiver) connected to an amp in my living room (next to recliner). Also, another separate DAC connected to an amp at my bedside, located on the nightstand - so I can listen in bed. The last listening station, that I rarely use, is a DAC / Amp next to the spare bed, in the room with my PC. Although the SHP9600 sounds better with a DAC or DAC/Amp, it can still be used with low powered devices without aid (pretty much all headphones sound better with a DAC or DAC amp)...so no worries if you don't have the equipment. The good thing is - since it's low impedance, if you do decide to get a stand alone amp, or DAC / amp combo, you don't need much power...which means you can get by with a cheaper unit. I personally like amps or DAC / amp combos that have at least a Bass boost switch or Bass and Treble adjustment knobs, or some other way to access an EQ (some have built in EQs or maybe a EQ app). This way, you can always make adjusts if necessary. If you're an audio purest, than it won't matter. If you use it with your phone, you can always use an EQ app if you feel like the 9600 needs more umph or adjustment. My favorite EQ app for Android is PowerAmp Equalizer - I think I had to pay a few bucks for the full version - totally worth it. That EQ (and others, such as Equalizer APO for PC - another great EQ) has built in professional EQs for the SHP9600. I use their pro EQ's as a starting point...then make minor tweaks from there. Sometimes I like the pro EQ as is. Just depends. As for this headphone itself, I'll usually listen to it as is (no EQ). It just depends on the source. The 9600 works for just about anything and everything (except places where you might be next to someone - where the sound leakage may be an issue...)  I've read countless reviews of various headphones. One comment I see a lot, is basically the following -  when people ""upgrade"" to another set, they first talk about how great they thought their previous set was... then, how the new ""upgraded"" set is even better - and say they won't bother using the old set anymore. *Now wait ---  I must say (regarding the SHP9600): if you spend some time enjoying these SHP 9600 headphones, you'll likely always love them. They have a special, warm, yet clear and detailed sound. Now sure - you can get other headphones that have the ability to extract even more detail, or more bass depth or more treble detail or more soundstage width or more soundstage depth or more midrange detail or THIS or THAT or Whatever...whatever...whatever....but pound for pound, these are hard to beat. They do have decent soundstage width and depth. I'd say decent for this bracket. The aren't quite as wide as something like the Hifiman Edition XS, or the AKG K701 / 702...but they certainly compete well against many Beyerdynamic, Audio Technica, Sony, etc, etc, and other brand headphone models I've tried. I wouldn't say they are exactly ""speaker - like"" headphones (like the planar Hifiman Edition XS - which sound like you are listening to large home stereo speakers a few feet away) BUT - they certainly aren't narrow ""in your head"" sound like many Bluetooth earbuds...Again, there is some decent soundstage width and depth. Some may say it's a Goldie locks zone - not too wide, not too narrow. It's also a pretty open sound too (not closed off by any means). Not all open backs sound open...I've heard some that are more like semi-open. So these are good on that point.  Rather than using EQ, try to take the time to train yourself using them as is - ""out of the box"" sound - you may just decide to listen to them without ever using an EQ. Maybe , maybe not. I like the tuning on these (for open backs). I have several sets of headphones. From wired to Bluetooth, over ear to on ear...I also have a couple dozen sets of earbuds - wired and Bluetooth...Here's some of my ""Wired Only"" sets (that still work like new...not previous headphones I no longer have ***Not in any particular order):  Philips X2HR, Beyerdynamic DT 770 & DT 990 & DT  1990 Mk2, Hifiman Edition XS & Deva Pro w/BT  mod & HE-9, Fiio FT1 closed, Audio Technica  WS1100 & PRO7X, AKG K702, V Moda LP2,  Monoprice Modern Retro & MP Semi-Open back  model, Skullcandy Crusher Wired (OG - w/ AA  battery powered amp), JVC XX series - both 40mm  & 50 mm, Pioneer DJ 500, and some wired IEMs... several other Bluetooth headphones that have wired options...and I may have missed one or 2 regular sets  *** My point by listing all that out - the SHP9600 is still a great headphone to me. I still enjoy using them. I'll never let them collect dust. Some of those I listed may be better headphones in one way or another...maybe even better all-around vs the 9600 - but the 9600 still has a prominent place in my growing collection due to their nice sound, easy to drive low impedance and superb comfort. I hope they continue to make these SHP9600 available for awhile.  ***Bottom line - I recommend the Philips SHP9600 to anyone and everyone who is looking for a comfortable, easy to use headphone, that has great sound quality and detail - especially considering the low price. They can be used for many things. At the very least, get them as a back up or secondary set. They belong in everyone's collection. If the price vs quality wasn't so good, I wouldn't say all this. It was absolutely worth my time and effort to make this review. I hope this helps :)",the United States,False,1,RF13JV3S9AXPV,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Good quality open-back design, lightweight and comfortable (with some caveats)",4.0,Marshal,2025-05-01,"I got these for PC use in my home, of which they do the job well. I was looking for the following traits: lightweight and comfortable, open back design, felt or fabric ear-cups, round ear-cups, 3.5mm cabling, good sound quality. I was replacing an old pair that had managed to last me over a decade.Open back design and Sound quality - Excellent. Open back was an important choice for me. The sound comes off natural, and you can still hear yourself and your environment (and those near you will be able to hear some of your audio). The bass is still very present, but might not be as prominent compared to closed back, but it is still more than enough for audio editing purposes for animation and video editing.Cable design - the cables feel cheap and like they may be fragile, but they're long and removable so they're easily replaced should they break. This is a good perk. The cables however do extend kinda far from the headphones themselves, so you may want to get a 3.5mm 90-degree elbow joint; if you tilt your head to the left, the jack digs into your shoulder, which isn't good for the cable's health.Padding - The ear cups are fabric. I prefer this over the more common pleather foam material as, coupled with the open back design, it's more breathable and comfortable for me. The fabric however is fairly stiff; it's not as cushy or soft as some other competitors. The ear cups are fairly deep as well.Oval ear cups - I would've preferred round ones; they hang a bit low as a result, which initially caused some discomfort (that fortunately has been corrected, see below).Size and shape - I had to slightly stretch the headphones over a box for a few days, as initially they clamped down on my head uncomfortably. Prior to doing so, they put a weird amount of pressure just below my ears / right at my jaw (due to the oblong ear cups) which gave me a headache, and I could only wear em for 30 minutes at a time; after doing so, they fit my head almost perfectly and I can wear them for hours without issue.Weight - They're fairly light, but as mentioned, I needed to stretch them so they didn't clamp down on my head.Overall - they're slightly on the pricey side, but they were the cheapest I could find that met most of my requirements. And at the price point provided, they feel like a decent value. Granted, that'll hinge on how long they last. (Hopefully if something does break, it's the cable which is easily replaceable.)",the United States,True,4,R3RDGBO9DPPX48,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great budget headphones but they only last 1-2 years in my experience",4.0,heh,2025-03-30,I have purchased them twice. The sound quality is great. They are very comfortable. Other headphones in this price range come with a leathery material that will degrade over time and likely be hot/uncomfortable on your ears. The mesh on these is very comfortable.The right side has lost sound for me in both pairs after ~1.5 years of use maybe 4-14 hours a day every day.If you are ok with replacing these every so often depending on how much you use them then they are an excellent budget headphone option.,the United States,True,3,R2BAG3YNGUY9N3,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

My only minor complaints: the aux cord out of the box is way too long for my use, but it can be changed.

Wow! Really impessed.",5.0,sifelaver,2025-03-09,"Took a chance on these. I am only really familiar with the brand via their grooming products. Was not expecting to like these as much as I do. Putting these on they cup my ears perfectly and then I forget they're on. There's no squeezing or pressure. I am a fairly average-sized adult male in most measurements. I didn't adjust them out of the box and realizing now that I can make them tighter or looser, so I wouldn't worry.I am not an audiophile and I don't believe that price always, 100%, equals value. I can say that the majority of my audio consumption is via headphones. Whether it's practicing a musical instrument, listening to a podcast or watching movies, headphones are usually on. This is mostly due to not wanting to disturb neighbors but also if there is not at least one other person in the room wanting to listen to something, I really don't need speakers. It's a nice treat once in a while to clean the living room with some great tunes going, but I rarely do this. Blast music that is. I clean !If you're like me and by default a headphone person but not necessarily an audiophile you probably already have a pair or two of phones for different purposes. I have great, inexpensive Tascam TH-02s which are closed and wonderful for focused listening or guitar playing. But for me hours of closed-back headphone use can be fatiguing.So, that's why I looked into open-ear headphones. I think it's good to change it up between phone types if you're an avid user. I also have the semi-open AKG K240 which are great. These fit into the mix well, and I definitely like them so far. P.S. a good tell is - is the cord detachable? Yes, this one is.All in all great to add to the headphone rotation to save my ears, minimize fatigue, and provide another listening angle.",the United States,True,2,R31UGR1S1S52DJ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

No ear fatigue. Absolutely zero. It’s lovely. Great for just hanging around and even gaming. Not really for doing things around the house if you have a small head, as for me it falls off and tilts forward.  2. Great for gamers and people in recording studios. You can get it with a mic. Kinda like VR sound. Very beautiful.3. You can hook up a tiny little Bluetooth plug in and make them Bluetooth. It’s not even expensive to do either.4. Feel like I can get a real true sound with these. I love base and I love noise canceling but I didn’t get them for this, I got them for truly listening to music of course. 5. That playlist on Spotify called Songs to Test Headphones in, had a whole new purpose.6. This had opened up my audiophile experience, I have Bose quiet comforts and marshals and sennheizers. I also have an assortment of ear buds too. These are great to have in your collection, along with the other collections. I’m still going to buy myself some new noise canceling headphones for the city trips I have to take.7.

Fine, but consider the Koss KPH40",3.0,Joseph Morris,2025-01-27,"I got a pair of SPH9600s for my eight year old child who really likes totally-over-the-ear headphones like this. And for her (and my six year old son has started borrowing them), they do work: these adjust well, they have excellent sound, and they feel like they are really firmly on your head, at least when one is sitting still.I, however, listen to music while doing things: cleaning up the kitchen, going for a walk, lifting weights. And for that, these are too big and heavy. Because of their higher mass, they slide around if you look down or around.So my daily driver headphones is the Koss KPH40X, which weighs about one-seventh as much as these (330g vs 44g), but checks all the same boxes. They are both open-back; they both have detachable cables; the drivers are similar at 45mm (Koss) and 50mm (Philips). There's the on- vs over-ear thing, of course, but for that I have no preconceived value add for either design.The sound quality is about the same: I just did a sound check between the two, using Wavelet (Android) with the Harman-curve for each one. There might be just a wee bit more sub-bass with the SHP9600 -- that extra 5mm of driver diameter working for you -- but not much (testing with the first few seconds of NIN's Down In It). The clarity and imaging of vocals on the KPH40X seems better, just more immediacy like the vocalist is right there in front of you (testing with Nena's 99 Luftballons). There is a different *feeling* of enclosure with the SHP9600 (your ear is after all still surrounded by a thick foam pad, somewhat more isolating) versus the total on-the-ear openness of the KPH40. Different but offhand seems neither good nor bad. But of course the main ""feeling"" difference is the ~290 grams of weight that are not there. Plus you also get to keep about $20-30.If you really want firm enclosing over-ear and not on-ear then yeah, maybe. But I've got both these in my house and the KPH40s, and I'll always pick up the KPH40s.",the United States,True,6,R3UUGQMPDH1IJF,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great for big heads!!!!",5.0,C. Barker,2024-11-28,"I've gone through a number of headsets because I have a big head and my ears often get pinched.  I use these headphones multiple hours a day. I also wanted an open back headset with cloth pads that do not pressure my eardrums with an airtight seal between my head and the headphones.  These headphones are very comfortable, and my ears do not ring after listening to music.  I can also hear things around the house as I'm working.  The openings in the ear pads are big enough for my ears to fit in them and not get pinched between the cushion and my skull.

After a year the audio jack will go bad",2.0,michael,2024-11-21,I can't give this product more than 2 stars when it did work I had no problems with it but a year ago the audio jack started giving me problems. I've been trying to ignore it but it's only gotten worse. Only one speaker would work and sometimes you would hear a lot of static which is the result of a faulty audio jack. The speakers themselves in the headphones work fine but the audio jack is very loose I've already replaced the audio wire multiple times thinking that it was the wire that was the problem when in fact it was the audio jack. If you buy these headphones beware they will not last you longer than a year and if I'm paying $80 for a pair of headphones I expect it to last at least 3 years.,the United States,True,2,R3ITFHOC6W11LK,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Good Sound",5.0,Madison,2024-11-18,"I'm writing this review after buying these headphones in January 2024, it is now November 2024.The cord is very long and the sound is good. It's very easy to use, a standard plug in headphone. There's no buttons for volume control but again it is a plug in. When I first got it I thought the ear muffs were a little firm but after wearing them for a while they aren't too bad. If you wear them for a long time they start to hurt your ears a bit. They aren't super heavy but they have some weight to it. I have dropped them a few times and they're fine so the headphones are sturdy enough to drop a couple times. The headphones are a good size however, you can not fold them. You can adjust them up or down for your head and ears but it is not foldable. Also you can still hear the TV or people talking in the background when you have these headphones on, although I tend to keep my computer volume low since they can get loud so that may impact your experience depending on how loud your volume is.Overall, these are worth your money if you're looking for a decent quality plug in headphones. If it's on sale even better because it'll really be worth it. Especially because they can endure a few drops on the floor. If you're looking for super high quality sound and everything then a different set of headphones might be better. But for decent quality these get the job done and so far they've lasted almost a year now.",the United States,True,3,RTCHOXYUGV4XE,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

They shine with movies/TV and pop/rock. They lack the last bit of air, treble refinement, and soundstage size compared to my nearly 6X expensive Sennheiser HD600's, but this is to be expected.

Best Headphones I've Owned",5.0,Zack Stephens,2024-09-28,"These are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. While it's hard to call myself a true audiophile, sound quality is very important to me across all my listening devices.Comfort: 5/5 - These are super lightweight, have great flexibility in the ear cups, a nice wide headband that is well cushioned and the perfect amount of clamping force. I hardly realize I still have them on after 10 minutes and even after hours of having them on I have no discomfort. The ear cups are nice and large and well cushioned, they don't touch any part of my ears and with the open back design, they are super breathable which prevents my ears from getting hot like with closed back headphones.Sound quality: 5/5 - Punchy and tight bass, well balanced mid and clear highs. I've heard details in songs and movies with these that I've missed with other headphones. They may tread a tad on the bassier side for some but it's by no means over done and in my opinion the ideal sound stage.My only small critique is the headphone jack. While there is nothing wrong with it at all, for most of my applications I prefer having the headphone jack on the right side of the headphones. If these included ports on either side they would be without flaw. Since this is my personal preference rather than a flaw with the headphones design it's hard to deduct any points from it.While I'm confident there are other headphones that sound better than these, the price you'll have to pay to get it isn't worth it to anyone but the most seasoned audiophiles. For the price, you'll be hard pressed to find a more comfortable pair of headphones that sound as good as these.",the United States,True,3,R1WEP9BMGDQ2FK,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Very fun and a great value",5.0,Squarehead,2024-09-11,"TL;DR: These headphones are very good for the price I got them, which was 70 bucks. The build, though it feels rattly in the hands, never does when it's on the head, and they are very comfortable. They sound very warm, from the bass to the mids, everything sounds extra thick, but didn't lose too much in the clarity department for this range of headphone. This is a really chilled out, lay back and enjoy the music/game/movie headphone.Okay, now time to give the full story of why I even tried these headphones.So I wanted to fill a very specific role. I actually have gone through my own audiophile journey for a while now. I got into the hobby about a decade ago, and got into open back headphones with the superlux hd681 evo, so very budget at the time. I think I paid like 35 bucks for those, so even half what I paid for the SHP 9600. Then after having those for a while, I upgraded to the SHP9500 (Yeah, I'll compare them a little later on), and then went to the HD6XX. So pretty standard, but after that I went a little off the beaten path and got the Monolith M1070. And then another couple years down the road got the Arya V3, or the Arya stealth. Couple all this with a few variations on Dacs and Amps, and I've had some experience with many tiers above the SHP9600.So why even bother with them? Well, headphones are just fun to play around with. But really, I started to put together a secondary setup in my home, and wanted a open back headphone that was also easy to drive with a ps5 controller, and one that of course sounded good enough. I didn't want to move the Arya around, and the dac amp set up that I have is not so portable from my main desk.Honestly the SHP9600 fit the bill very well. I ended up returning them in favor of something else that suited my fancy a little better after some thought. But as a guy who has listened to what were originally $1600 headphone(Though the Arya stealth now go for $650, I thought I got them for a good deal at $1000, but damn), the SHP9600 were still fun to listen to. I wouldn't pay more than $100 for them, but anything less and this is a very fine headphone.The bassThese are a budget open back headphone, so the sub bass isn't very great, but the bass otherwise is a little elevated and makes the entire headphone feel warm. This bleeds into the mids too, but not in a super offensive way. It's enjoyable. You do lose some forwardness in the clarity department, I wouldn't say the bass is super detailed, but it doesn't feel particularly muddy either. The bass is decently textured.MidsKind of mentioned it in the bass section, but the mids are very warm. It's relaxed, smoothed out, sounds thick and kind of honey like. This is where the most muddiness comes in, and its not a whole lot, because vocals still are forward. The timbre, the characteristics of the sound, are just fuller. It is not what I would call bloated exactly. I guess I am surprised by how thick sounding these are without having to sacrifice much clarity and not introducing a lot of muddiness is pretty impressive. So, somehow, I think this will be the make or break of this headphone. If you want a very clean sound, like a little more accurate, then the original SHP9500 might be a little better. But if you just want to enjoy without trying to analyze, the SHP9600 is just more fun. If I personally had to choose, I would actually pick the SHP9600, but that's partially because I have the Arya, which are very neutral.Treble:Another factor that changed alot. It's less sibilant than the SHP9600, but that means the imagine suffers a TINY bit. Honestly, I felt the SHP9600 still retrieves details just like the SHP9500, it's just two steps back. The timbre between the SHP9500 and 9600 in this range was basically identical. But the treble is just smoothed out more on the SHP9600. The treble extension is not that far, but good enough.Soundstage:These headphones are pretty darn wide. To my ears, they were actually wider than the SHP9500. The imaging is good on them too. Very solid. I'm honestly not the greatest judge on this honestly. I play games, but not competitively, just a single player game enjoyer. But the imaging sounded correct. Not razer focused, but accurate.Conclusion: For 70 dollars, you could do a lot worse. I liked them a lot, and if I had to choose only one headphone to have within a budget, I would feel good about these. I ended up returning them, because I decided that I wanted to push my budge a tier higher and get something that is just ridiculously fun, and not neutral, because I already have that. So I got the X2HR. Those headphones aren't perfect, and honestly I think some would find the SHP9600 to sound better than the X2HR. But for me, they did enough cool things, while being enough of a departure from the neutral that I already have at my main desk.Oh, I don't have the SHP9500 anymore. After many years of use, one of the drivers got a little weaker, so some channel imbalance. I don't think it is normal for the headphones to do that, but I did have them for like 5 years.Yep, long winded, but if you made it down here, congrats! Hope I offered some insight, or at least some entertainment. Good luck in your audio journey!",the United States,True,36,R3NJK5W62LU5V6,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Closer to on ear than over ear",4.0,Saleem,2025-09-18,"Sound fine. ANC isn't perfect but you get what you pay for, you're not getting Sony or Apple level ANC in these. Biggest issue is they're stated to be over ear but in my experience they rest on top of your ear mostly, which is frustrating as I wear glasses. These press into my glasses making them a tad uncomfortable. If you're looking for budget wireless headphones these will happily fill that role, though I do suggest investing into more expensive headphones if you plan to take these out and about. I mostly used these at home to watch movies without waking the family, or read while listening to music and knocking out the drone of the A/C.",the United States,True,0,R1J6PAPO7GKBGA,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

They are not to bulky, fit well, and do not get tight on your head. He has connected them to his iPhone through Bluetooth and really loves the functionality that the app provides right on his phone. The connectivity of the headphones also allows him to connect to his iPad and out living room television. They seem sturdy and durable as they have not broken after over a month of consistent use. Music and spoken word podcasts sound clear. I was concerned that the volume is so loud that it's really the volume control and not the noise canceling functionality that stops him from hearing me, but the its not.

Its sound quality is outstanding. The ear pads are very soft and comfortable. The controls are simple and easy. Bluetooth connectivity is great no dropouts and impressive range, it pairs with no problems and delivers an amazing sound in rich bass and the sound quality surprises me at this price point. The battery lasts longtime and the noise canceling works real well! The only issue is the a little wind noise that can impact your listening experience while running or bicycling outside on a very windy day but I am sure all other higher priced headphones sets have the same problem. Overall it is a great product that also comes with an app where you can dial in your equalizer settings but in my experience all default settings are more than enough. Time will show how durable this product is but I will be taking with me on the plane and will update this review in a few weeks. It seems well built, lightweight and the aux connector serves me well on my podcast console. I like the black color that matches most of my sound equipment.

But even without custom settings, you simply can't beat these for 20 bucks. Especially if you like to hear the full spectrum of bass, straight down to 20hz.

These clamp down comfortably and do a great job blocking out backround noise passively. They're pretty lightweight so easy to walk around with.

Unlike other brands of headphones the ear cushions are still fine. The headband cushion on the other hand isn't. I've had to tape it up because the cushion cover was peeling away from the cushion. Probably means it's time to replace the cushion, but I'm not an expert on how to replace headphone cushions of any kind so...small duck tape roll it is until the sound or connectivity goes. Love the way it folds for travel, means I can fit it in my purse well. Also appreciate the L and R on the inside of the ear cushions area.

Even at the regular price, Souncore H30i will by far exceed any expectations.I bought JBL 520 headphones and returned them because they weren’t very loud, the bass wasn’t what I was looking for, and the ear cups came off way too easily. Then I bought these to check out instead the following day. The difference is honestly insane. Soundcore H30i are surprisingly loud, as in loud enough that turned all the way up hurts your ears almost, and the bass is heavy. It doesn’t even matter for me that they aren’t noise canceling because I couldn’t hear anyone when they tried to talk to me today at work when I was blasting EDM and cleaning. They seem to be pretty sturdy and a plenty comfortable fit for my head. My job is physical and I’m moving up and down a lot, they didn’t slide off at all which was wonderful. I’m definitely happy about this purchase!I also appreciate soundcore for having fast charging headphones throughout, I don’t think I’ve ever had a pair die on me before I got them to a charger!

I definitely respect Anker for their efforts to make things right by their customers.Unfortunately, eventually the new headphones met the same end, snapping at the same weak spot at the joint between the band and earpiece, despite that I was EXTRA careful with them this time because of my past experiences.Anker puts out some great products—I own several—this just doesn’t happen to be one of them.————-I loved these headphones - great sound quality for the price, comfortable, understated aesthetics; these headphones checked all the right boxes for me. That is, until they broke at the thin joint between the band and the earpiece.I take very good care of my headphones, even the crappy-quality ones I just like for their unique looks. And I definitely took care of these Soundcores. So when they snapped at the joint, I figured maybe I got a flawed set, and didn’t think twice about purchasing a replacement.Sadly, the second pair snapped at the very same joint.Needless to say I won’t be purchasing a third pair, nor can I recommend anyone else do so. They’ll only make you love them, then turn around and break your heart.",the United States,True,9,R239T1RAKFH794,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Comfortable, quality sound, great bluetooth",5.0,craig of course,2024-12-08,"I bought the h10 (holiday sale $22) to use with a 9 band equalizer. I'm not yet willing or ready for hearing aids! I used an optical splitter (BlueRigger Toslink digital optical audio splitter adapter around $8). Connect splitter to TV optical output and one port goes to soundbar and other port to the digital to analog decoder which ill describe  in a minute. I can now hear 2KHz and above thx to the equalizer (behringer mini fbq800 from Sweetwater.com around $70). BTW, I have Bose OVER the ear ANC ($$$$) but wanted simple ON the ears and h10 is perfect ($). My wife likes the sound very low from the soundbar and I can now turn up the headphones volume to add many more years to a happy marriage. As for gear, connect TV optical to OREI DA34 digital to analog decoder audio converter (this unit processes the all-important Dolby signal and PCM) around $30. Connect the DA34 to the equalizer. In order to provide Bluetooth, output the equalizer to a wireless Bluetooth transmitter. I use the MEE audio Connect around $20. Turn on TV, equalizer, put h10 into pairing mode (press button for 5 sec) and press MEE button. Voila. Yes, there is a very slight audio latency with Bluetooth in the headphones, but the soundbar volume is low and the earphones is a bit higher so it is not distracting for me. If the soundbar is off, it's all moot.",the United States,True,0,RIN5YCAJBQ7SZ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Fantastic Portable headphones.",5.0,Devin D. Bass,2024-11-20,These are great portable headphones they fold nicely and store easily in your backpack. I recommend you buy a hard shell case to protect these headphones.  They hold a charge for a long time I would say about12 to 14 hours.  The sound quality is excellent the bass is very strong and crystal clear.  I don't think they are marketed as noise cancelling but when I am wearing them I don't hear much from the outside.  They have a strong fit very snug. I think If you have a Large head these might be too tight.  These are great sounding affordable headphones.

Done With Buds Forever, Incredible Value",5.0,D. Glassner,2024-10-18,"I collect headphones, or as some might say, I'm a headphone hobbyist. In my collection are HiFiMan, Sennheiser, and AKG high-end headphones. I always used a set of buds for knocking around, walking the dog, and talking on the phone. My last two pairs were from Soundcore, including Liberty Pro 3s which I paid over $100 for. They were okay, but despite trying many different tips, they would fall out of my ear, not provide a good seal, I'd accidentally hang-up on folks by pushing a bud back into my ear or eventually get clogged with earwax.This time when it came time to replace my buds I thought I'd try something different. Despite my bad experiences with buds, I've always appreciated the value, sound, and features of Soundcore products. Because I have no use for gimmicks like noise-canceling, etc., I looked through the line-up to see which set of Soundcore cans had none of those useless (to me) features and found these for $25-ish.As far as price-to-quality ratio, these are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. The microphone is stellar (it sounds as good as most podcasts I listen to, even better than some), the sound for listening to calls or podcasts is great, and to my surprise, music sounds better than virtually any bud I've ever owned. And even music sounds great, which was not even my main usage for these. Do they have as flat and detailed of a response as my best, open-back headphones...? Of course not. They have a bit of boost in the bass, like many less expensive earphones. However, even this can be adjusted with the EQ in the free SoundCore app.Much to my surprise, given that they don't even cover the entire ear, wearing them even without anything playing seems to block out about 85% of outside noise. I will say, they fit very snugly, some might even say tight. My head must be on the smaller side, because I rarely have to extend headphones beyond the smallest size, and still they are VERY snug. I doesn't bother me, but they might become uncomfortable after an hour or two. However, I don't use these for long listening sessions... I have many, much better wired headphones for that.These are the best Bluetooth headphones I've ever had, including my first pair ever, my now long-gone $300 Sony MDR-1R. For $25! For that money, I was expecting something with good utility for my purposes. What I got was a really fun pair of cans.",the United States,True,28,R3DIOPSYV8ISPY,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Absolutely best fullsize headphones for price to performance",5.0,John Glen,2024-10-05,"Anker always comes through with excellent products that hit the sweet spot on price without compromises in features. The H30i has an awesome battery life that's taken me multiple days to totally run through. The microphone quality is great for phone calls and I never have issues with clarity. Audio quality is great, bass is great. The buttons are just what you need and nothing unnecessary yet give a satisfying and responsive click. The H30i's USB-C port is great and let's you get rid of your outdated USB Micro-B cables. The earcups have the ability to swivel and spin together with an adjustable band for improved comfort. The design is professional yet elegant. The H30i even supports a headphone jack. Unfortunately, the H30i's internal microphone does not work while wired, but you can buy an aux cable with an inline microphone to use the H30i as a proper headset even while wired.

The only missing component is another microphone (to block out background noise while on calls), and noise canceling. But I know what I bought, so that's not a fault of the product. Liked so much I bought another set.I will add that the oblong shape of the headband does cause some ear discomfort after wearing for a while, since they don't sit ""flat"" as much as the swivels help align them on the ear. Maybe it's just my head shape or ear placement, but a similar set from another brand doesnt have this problem since the headband is more rounded.",the United States,True,2,RTMR4Z26GZC39,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Perfect for the kids for riding in the car",3.0,Kevin Gray,2025-09-16,"I wanted a new set of headphones for the kids to use with their various devices, and I did not want to pay a lot for them because they lose or break their headphones at an alarming rate. I picked these up because they seemed to have the features my kids are looking for in headphones. As a musician, producer, and DJ for over 40 years, I just had to pop them on my head and listen to one of my favorite artists to try them out.First, let’s talk construction. The overall physical build is pretty good, and the ear cups are comfortable. All of the connections seem to be solid, and I did not notice any pops or cracks from faulty wiring. There is a volume control with basic volume up and volume down buttons, as well as a button that toggles play and pause. There is a microphone in the housing that holds the buttons as well. The headband is expandable and foldable, and the earcups can rotate 90 degrees. The connecting cable is covered with a weave to help prevent kinks. Finally, there is a 3.5mm output jack on the bottom of the right earcup so you can share your listening with a friend.Let’s start with the good. These headphones are indeed comfortable to wear for an extended time. I listened to two full albums with a total run time of about an hour and 20 minutes, and I did not get uncomfortable wearing them. The earcups did provide a pretty decent outside noise-canceling environment. The shared audio jack provided a consistent audio signal to share.The audio quality is ok, but not great.

These headphones are comfortable, lightweight, and fold up nicely for easy storage. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price point — not Bose-level, but definitely better than expected and plenty for most uses. The in-line controls are a nice bonus, and the headphones overall feel durable. The only drawback is the microphone: it picks up your voice clearly, but also a lot of background noise. That makes it fine for quiet classrooms or office settings, but not ideal for walking around or noisy environments. Still, given the price, it’s a solid choice especially if listening is your main goal.",the United States,False,0,RUZZJY89RDPNY,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great deal on nice headphones!",4.0,Lesli Neuenschwander,2025-09-14,"I got these to use while watching movies, because I like to get stereo sound for the best effect.  First off, these are a great deal!  I have been looking for some decent headphones that are comfortable to wear, for quite awhile.  These have nice sound, not s suuuuuper great full range of bass, but hey, I'm not that fussy--anything is so much better than the speakers on my laptop.  I do also want to use these with the phone, but haven't tested that out yet, but am glad to have the microphone option.  Comes with decent-ish instructions, and they aren't hard to figure out.  Only thing that dinged a star for me, is they run large.  Even pushed down to the smallest adjustment, they are sill too big for my head.

Not very durable.",2.0,caro930,2025-09-01,"These headphones delivered fair sound output for the price, but are extremely flimsy in your hands and feel like pieces keep trying to fall off.Comfort-wise, the padded earcups sit over the ears properly, and they are no-doubt a lightweight build. They’re not noise-cancelling, so there is not much to block out background distractions.The volume control and play/pause button on the cord functioned adequately and as expected, as did the 3.5mm jack when used across devices like phones, laptops, tablets, etc. (some necessitating an adapter, which is expected).The foldable design would have been a nice touch for storage and travel if it didn't feel like something was at imminent risk of breaking off each time I fold them. They don’t feel robust or durable, I hate to say. They fit fine but do require frequent adjustment so they're not very convenient for long-term lengthy-session use.Overall, this pair of wired headphones are about as budget-friendly as they get.

He's in 3rd grade but they fit him on the smallest size and they are fairly tight fitting so they should stay on his head. I like that they fold in two different ways so you can fold them based on how you need to store them. We prefer to get our kids these kinds of wired headphones that can link to each other so that they can listen to a movie on the tablet together without using a splitter or Bluetooth that needs charging. The sound quality is pretty basic. I tested them listening to a show on my computer, so mostly dialogue, and I can tell a difference in tone compared to my earbuds. The tones sound less rich, probably a lack of base. The volume buttons on the cord didn't work on my laptop.

Great sound, cheap materials (headband keeps breaking)",2.0,S. Das,2025-06-25,"These headphones are good and sound great. I use them for many hours daily to listen to music or to dampen the external noise while working at my computer.Unfortunately, the band that goes over the head to keep headphones in place is too stiff. After short use, it cracks -- right along the middle. After that, the headphones are still working, but won't stay on the head.I thought I broke the first one by being careless. For the second one, I blamed my kids for touching my stuff (because I was careful not to overstretch the headphones). Alas, the third and fourth broken ones confirmed that it's indeed the faulty design.If they use material to allow for more flexibility, these headphones would be awesome, worthy of a 5-star rating. However, with them breaking every 1-2 months, this is NOT a good value for the money.",the United States,True,0,R1FMK85MN0PJI5,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

As the other wireless headphones that are supposed to be able to work with the cable if the battery is dead - we didn't find that to be true.  The wired headphones make it simple and we don't have to worry about another thing to charge.  They also do a great job isolating sound and dampening the background environment.  They hold up with repeated use as they are used for online classes and meetings.  We've only had to replace one headphone because of the plastic breaking.

Usually thats after wearing them for an hour or more but honestly the cups could be slightly larger, or replaceable, and could fit around the ear better.

You can also use them with a jack if bluetooth isn't an option for the media he's using.  The case is spectacular.  They're a little pricey, but they LAST--very durable.

My fix is to superglue the ear cushions in place.  I've had to replace some ear cushions with aftermarket alternatives, where they have fallen off and gotten lost or discarded.

While they’re definitely on their last leg now, I’m thoroughly impressed with their durability, especially for the price.Speaking of price, I was pleasantly surprised to see they’ve only increased by $1 since we first purchased them ($17.99 then, $18.99 now), even with inflation. For how well these have performed, I have no hesitation buying them again. Not only are they practical, but they’re also adorable. The lavender color is so cute.Overall, I highly recommend these headphones. They’re durable, adorable, and budget friendly! :)",the United States,True,0,R1YVR5D5X6ZHB0,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Less comfortable than before",3.0,I.S.,2025-05-28,"I bought a white pair in April 2024 and used them daily until I bought a replacement black pair in April 2025. The white ones were very comfortable, but the plastic connections to both earphones eventually broke (early 2025). I used them very often and loved the sound.The new pair, however, is far less comfortable than the previous pair even though I purchased from the exact same listing. It is far tighter and regularly gives me headaches, which the old ones did not do even when they were new. They clearly made some changes (as the new ones no longer silence music to announce that noise cancelling is on/off, but instead speak over it, which I do prefer) and it feels like they made them tighter while doing so. I'll have to buy different ones because I cannot put up with the headaches, even if the sound quality is great.Sound quality is good and the earphones themselves are comfortable.

Lasted almost a year and a half with 12+hr of daily wear",5.0,Goat,2025-04-12,My current pair just stopped working after over a year. These head phones are extremely comfortable and don't push on my ears or glasses like other head phones. I have fallen asleep with them on multiple times and wear them around 10-14 hours nearly every day if not actively wearing them they are often around my neck. The noise canceling on them works well. And they only needed to be charged once or twice a week. With in the last 2-3 months the material around they head phones has pulled up exposing the foam cushioning. Despite still being regulary worn the foam stayed in place and they were still extremely comfortable to wear.,the United States,True,9,RXCX7095D6N80,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headset Model H30",5.0,Michael A Kiedrowski,2025-04-04,I read about several different headsets before choosing this this noise cancelling headset. I wanted bluetooth for freedom of movement. There were several more expensive sets and several less expensive. I weighed everything I read and chose this one. I am glad I did because it is a nice set that was ready to go out of the box. It paired with my computer right away. The other consideration for me was how fast could i get it. I thought maybe a couple days. It turned out to be  matter of hours which worked out well for me.

Huge Drop In Quality- Don‘t Buy",1.0,Hilary,2025-08-04,"I first started buying these headphones a year or two ago when the first pair broke after a year of use. Not a big deal and they were only 30 dollars and lasted so long, so I bought another pair.  That had a sharp drop in quality and rise in price, resulting in them breaking in about 4 months. For some foolish reason, I bought another pair for now $50. These ones barely lasted two weeks before snapping. I‘m not rough with my headphones, I don’t take them on rocket ships or beat them with hammers- they stay on my head or by my desk and somehow manage to snap themselves as i leaned against the wall. Seriously, how do headphones snap from leaning gently against a wall? I‘m a little teenage girl, not a body builder or the type to slam my head against walls.

Not suitable for my needs as a constant user.",3.0,Kat,2025-05-01,"I’m a nearly 24/7 headphones wearer so have a lot of important criteria. My current daily drivers are the skullcandy uproar wireless, which have been frustratingly discontinued, so… the search begins. First and foremost, my headphones need to be comfortable and they can not make me overheat. These were both a little uncomfortable, and already made me feel too warm within just a few minutes of wear. I specifically gave these a chance because another reviewer said they didn’t cause overheating, but this was not the case for me. A lot of the discomfort was from the tightness of the band, which will loosen over time so I’m willing to forgive it, but the ear cups—while decently soft and squishy—seemed to reflect my own body heat back at me and amplify it. This would make them unwearable for even an hour, let alone a full day. I will say that I appreciated the design of how the band is adjusted, because they adjust higher up, meaning it gives both a little more width and a little more length than other, similar designs. Many headphones continue to squeeze your ears tight to the side of your face no matter how long the extension is, but the additional widening helped enough that I can see how they’d be very comfortable with some wearing in.These sound excellent, which I’ve come to expect from Skullcandy. The sound is clear and un-muffled, and does not feel lacking. I don’t really know the differences in sound descriptions and words, but skullcandy has always sounded very, very good to me when it comes to listening to every kind of media I can think of.The buttons are too small to quickly find when you need to pause or adjust the volume, and I pause my sound a significantly high number of times per day, so this would be a problem. I could add dots of puffy paint to them if I wanted to make them more prominent, but I’d already decided these weren’t keepers. They’re also grouped really closely together and feel sort of “mushy” when you press them, which makes the physical act of doing so a bit difficult if your fingertips are hyperflexible. The absolute distaste I have for these buttons was a HUGE part of rejecting the headphones overall, as well as the fact there seems to be a bit of a delay when you press play/pause to when it actually activates. So on top of pressing the button being a slow event, the action itself is slowed, as well. No thanks.All in all, these are not the WORST headphones I’ve ever tried, but I decided in less than an hour they weren’t worth a hoot at all for me.If you’re also a nonstop headphones user, I’d recommend finding something else for your daily driver.",the United States,True,0,R1YCAW47CDQXAE,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

By comparison, I purchased these to replace an older set of Beats Studio HD headphones and was pleasantly surprised that the Skullcandy's sounded better than the Beats.The fit is good, even with my larger knoggin' and the on-ear cushions are very soft. That lead me to one of my negatives. The fabric that encloses the earpieces is very flimsy and I can see these fraying or tearing very easily. Another drawback is the chord. It is short and it is fixed to the headphones so there is no replacing it with a longer chord.Even with the negatives, I found these headphones to be a great value for the price and am very happy with the quality of sound they put out",the United States,True,3,R2E34EWRUJ9V7I,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I’m very dissatisfied with these headphones. You can barely turn up the volume withought the people around u hearing ur music, unfortunately that ruins them for me. But they are very comfortable and if u don’t mind the volume struggles they arnt the worst. This is a video of my freind wearing them and turning up and down the volume .

Great Sound, Great Price, and Comfortable!",4.0,Alex,2025-06-19,"Very good cost/value product. I can’t stand headphones w/o bass; luckily, these headphones have great bass and sound quality overall. Very comfortable to wear! Great connectivity, although I have not really tested the range. I have only tried to talk on the phone 2x, but even in my apartment (no wind or outside noise), I was told I sound funny, or hard to hear. (Hence the 4 Stars) If you plan to make a lot of calls, probably not for you, but if you want a set of comfortable and great sounding headphones for a good price, these are for you. (5 Stars) Also, they have good tension (so far) so not likely to slip off head.",the United States,True,1,R2PORKF3S4Y9G,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Underwhelmed",3.0,Mrs. Combs,2025-06-15,"I normally love Soundcore. Unfortunately, these fall short for me. They aren’t comfortable to wear, the ear pads must be for show because they aren’t cushioned, the padding is very unsubstantial. They don’t feel quality-made and they’re kind of heavy. They’re not very portable either, they don’t fold up at all. The sound is definitely less quality than my Soundcore earbuds. It was a minor hassle to get them to connect with my iPhone.

If You Don’t Want to Deal With an App, Get the Previous Model",4.0,Ivy,2025-06-15,"I had a previous version of these, which had started to peel around the ear cushions, but otherwise worked great. The sound quality was wonderful, but the previous version had gone up over $30 in price (basically double the price of the new ones), so I replaced my old pair with this one. With the old ones, you turn them on, pair them with Bluetooth, and it says battery high, medium, or low. With these new ones, you have to download an app and check the app for battery level, which is a pain. I think the new ones may have a slightly longer battery life (which was already great) and the app is useful because it tells you battery percentage, but I still think it’s a pain. I thought about exchanging them for my old ones but decided to keep the new ones instead. The old ones lasted 41/2 years before they started peeling.",the United States,True,5,RA5L0B0YQZOL6,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Im guessing I have to wait til an update comes each time. I dont know.other than that flaw they're great, more comfortable than my on ear beats and I paid 120 for those. I'd buy two to compensate but because of chromebook, that bums me out. Chromebook needs to do something about that.",the United States,True,0,R2UWH27WNULFWB,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Nice NC headphones",4.0,C.L.,2025-09-10,"Nice noise canceling headphones. It helps to block out ambient noise like a/c, fan, dishwasher, etc extremely well. I do wish the fit was better though. It is very comfortable and soft, but the band is limited to how small it will go. I am not someone with a very small head and it fits loose on me at the smallest setting. However, the softness of the material, the fexibility of the headset to your movements is great for the price. The sound is nice as well. I do use it for cleaning, walks, and when I want to block out ambient noises while I paint. I haven't used it for gaming. I would think it might be ok for cozy games but anything else you might want to get one of their other headsets.",the United States,False,0,RS5E0R109LTQU,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Best deal!",5.0,M3party,2025-08-29,This is my second pair! The first pair I ended up giving to my elderly mother for her TV in a skilled nursing facility. I bought these ones for myself. The sound quality is incredible. Extremely comfortable even when I am sweating. Noise canceling with these options has been a game changer for various types of exercise or even just cooking at home while listening to an audiobook. Highly recommend!,the United States,True,0,R373RXUA1LI4A0,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Well built for the price",5.0,Tzen lee,2025-09-18,"Pretty good for the price on sale. Solid for my first set of noise cancelling headphones. To be straight forward I just feel like it could have been better with bass and noise leak. As I really want to rock to my new headphones, but in the end with a bit of tweaking in the app it sounds better I guess. And the second caveot is how I'm at 50% or above the volume and it already leaks my music towards all to hear. It ain't as bad, but in a quiet room with few others. I bet they can hear me bobbing to my bops.But the biggest pros that I would give them is they sound good for just 50$, noise cancellation works pretty alright. And quality is definitely there, even tho I just now read on Reddit that some parts are fragile and may be prone to breaking. I really hope not, as they feel solid with good materials and are comfortable. As I have a big head, and the ear cups are just so soft.For the price and quality of the build, I would say they are a worthy pickup. As much as I would like to spend 100-200$ on other brands. These just fits the budget I'm at at the moment, for those movie late nights and morning motivation beats and muse, they will do the job just fine. Plus they are made with Anker, the guys that makes portable power banks, thus far I'm still at 90% battery, which is a bonus. I've wore mines for the whole day, ever since they arrived at t 6am in the morning. Pretty much am well accustomed to them now.Also I like how I can use 2 devices at once with them too. While playing PC games to just doom scrolliing on my phone. Without making too much of a racket, which is very very nice.Overall, good if you're on a budget. But best try to get em on sale. They also seem to have cheaper and more expensive options too of different models.",the United States,True,0,R1GWQNSNYK4144,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Not thrilled with the updates that make the product worse than the previous version",3.0,Page One,2025-09-11,"This is my second time buying these exact same headphones. I thought they would be the same, but some of the programming (is that the correct word for it?) has been changed. A piece of the plastic broke just above the earcups broke a few days ago, so I figured I'd replace them with the same model, a good deal for the price. When I turned the old version on, it would say battery high or battery medium, or battery low, but this new version doesn't tell you how the battery is. Why, knowing how much battery life you have is important. I would charge them when I stopped using them anytime it didn't say battery high when I turned them on. How am I supposed to know how much battery time I have left? I go to sleep later than my wife, so these are great for watching TV. Also, there are 3 listening modes, transparency, normal, and noise canceling which again  when you switched told you which mode it was in, but this new version just has a tone instead. I don't understand tones, I understand words. Why do companies have to make changes that make the product worse? These are quality headphones, but why do I need to guess how much battery is left, and what mode I'm in when the older version let you know these things?",the United States,True,2,REC3YQIH93FSD,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Quality Over Ear Headphones",5.0,Shelby,2025-09-10,"I never write reviews however I just wanted to say— if you’re on the fence about buying these or buying a famous competitors version of headphones (eats with a ‘B’), save yourself some money. I will preface, the only reason I had to buy these is because the aforementioned competitors headphone headband cracked in the middle of a workout while I was adjusting the band after it had slipped off my sweaty ears for the umpteenth time.Anyways.. the ANC on these is God tier. The only qualms are that the volume could be a tad lighter (though I know my poor ears would say otherwise) and the function button on the sides aren’t as intuitive as leading competitors.I love how the ear pieces are snug on my head and never fall off even when I’m dripping sweat on a long run.  The charge time is super quick and the battery is long lasting. These pair easily and don’t randomly disconnect during a phone call. I’ve been mentioning this brand to everyone I can.

While the sound quality is decent and the noise cancellation is acceptable—though nowhere near the level of the Sony headphones I previously owned—the build quality leaves much to be desired.Around the 18-month mark, the ear cup covers began to deteriorate. The seam started tearing, and now over 50% of the yellow foam is exposed on both sides. This significantly affects comfort and aesthetics. For a product that’s otherwise functional, the poor durability of the ear cushions is a major letdown.If you're looking for budget-friendly headphones with okay performance, these might suffice.

They're also super comfortable to wear for long periods and come with a nice case and an audio cable (for wired use if you need it).The app is great — really intuitive, and I like being able to adjust the EQ and noise canceling modes. Bluetooth pairing was basically instant. Whatever NFC or fast-pairing tech they use, it worked flawlessly right out of the box.The only downside for me is I wish the max volume went a little higher.

A Feature-Packed Headphone That Punches Above Its Price",5.0,Rich Reviews,2025-08-24,"A Feature-Packed Headphone That Punches Above Its PriceThe Soundcore Life Q30 quickly became a daily-use headset for me. Setup was straightforward, and multipoint pairing works as advertised—I can switch between my laptop and phone without fumbling with Bluetooth settings. Comfort is excellent: the earcups are plush, don’t clamp too hard, and I can wear them for hours without fatigue.Sound quality is where these shine for their price. Out of the box, the tuning is bass-forward, but using the companion app to adjust the EQ brought the mids and highs into balance. Music feels full, podcasts come through clearly, and they get loud without distortion. The Hi-Res certification is more than marketing fluff—paired with lossless files, the detail is noticeably better than most budget headphones I’ve tried.Noise cancellation is impressive for the cost bracket. It won’t rival premium brands on an airplane, but it takes the edge off household noise, HVAC hum, and outside traffic. The three ANC modes (Transport, Outdoor, Indoor) are practical, and I found “Indoor” most versatile. Transparency mode is surprisingly natural, letting me hear conversations without yanking off the headset.Battery life is outstanding—I’ve been charging once a week with heavy use, and the quick-charge feature (a few hours of playback after a short plug-in) is handy. The included case and folding design make these travel-friendly.If I had to nitpick, the touch controls on the earcups can be hit-or-miss, and the headset is a bit bulkier than sleeker alternatives. But those are minor trade-offs considering the performance.Bottom line: These headphones deliver premium features—ANC, app EQ, comfort, and stellar battery life—at a midrange price, making them one of the best values I’ve found in wireless headphones.",the United States,True,0,R29UDOYLC0AR65,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great Sound, Comfortable Fit – But Durability Disappointing",2.0,bob,2025-08-22,"I’ve bought two pairs of the Soundcore Q30 headphones — one to replace a stolen set that I really liked. These headphones deliver impressive sound quality for the price, with strong bass, clear mids, and decent noise cancellation. They’re also very comfortable to wear for long sessions, and the battery life is excellent — I could go days without needing a charge.That said, I’m disappointed in the build quality.  The ear cups started to crack and split over time, and needed to be replaced. At least they were fairly inexpensive and easy to replace. However, despite always keeping them in a case and never dropping them, the plastic frame also developed cracks. It’s frustrating to see this kind of wear and tear on headphones that were treated with care.If you're prioritizing sound, comfort, and battery life, the Q30s are solid.

There is also a SoundCore app and it connects to the headphones and you can get access to custom EQs and sales from Soundcore. I can't speak for how well they hold up yet, I am sure it depends on how you care for them.  If you have never used over-ear headphones just know even inside your ears and the side of your head gets hot. (Was an adjustment for me)I really like the product, and for the price they sound great and perform as I expected them too.",the United States,True,0,R1DI7R0VJ1YUOO,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Good sound and lightweight.",5.0,manny,2025-09-09,I wanted some light headphones that sound great but dont get in the way during a gym session. Noise cancellation has some good reduction but its about 75% of outside sound. They are also useful if you want to wear them during a study session to not hear anything. At around $100 i think they provide good value for the money because the sound quality is pretty good for the price bracket they belong to.Portablity isnt very good because they dont fold and if you wear them on your neck they dont fold so that the cups face you so you wouldnt be able to protect them from rain or the outside environment. They connect pretty quickly though and the battery lasts a long time.

Average Headphones",3.0,R.J. MacReady,2025-09-02,"They do a pretty good job of cancelling out noise.  The first time I wore them I felt like I got a concussion, so I set them aside and bought a different pair to use daily.

The audio quality is okay, it often sounds like I'm listening through a can.  They don't fold up nicely and there isn't a carrying case or anything for them, so if you have a dusty house they will get dirty.

PINK COLOR IS NOT PINK",1.0,amanda,2025-08-17,"They work fine, bought them for a flight across country and have zero complaints on functionality. Comfort wise, they have an awkward fit but it can be adjusted.Unfortunately I can’t give them anything above 1 star. When buying a product, you expect to receive what you see in an image. Companies have access to studio lighting and one would assume it is tailored to give an accurate depiction of product visual.However the color on the pink, is lavender. I genuinely believe the product designer was color blind because the product, is purple. The picture is extremely misleading. I like purple, but was expecting pink.As someone who, and most baby pink enthusiasts will agree, likes to find shades that match; this was extremely disappointing.I’m posting this in hopes that if you are a pink lover, you avoid this product so you don’t get disappointed like me.I’m unsure if it was an issue in manufacturing, but every image I’ve looked at, even on Sonys website depicts them as pink. It’s even labeled.. as pink..Natural, and really any lighting I’ve tried, it’s always purple. I made sure to have some pink examples in the images for reference.",the United States,True,1,R1D5KUXWUFIHZ8,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

One of the best kids friendly headphones you can find",5.0,Ish,2024-09-18,"After doing some research on kid-friendly headphones, Skullcandy’s Grom headphones stood out for its price. They offer much better quality , look cooler than many similarly priced headphones and more comfortable. These are over-ear headphones rather than on-ear, which not only adds to the comfort but also helps reduce outside noise. I see some people complain about their ears don’t fit in the cups but we had no issues with our 5 and 8 years old kids. I was pleasantly surprised to find one of the earcup is a push button which wasn’t mentioned in the product description. They can press on the earcup to play/pause music or skip tracks. While it might seem a bit advanced for kids, they get used to it quickly.We have both the wireless and wired versions. To be fair, the wireless model offers more features for the price because you can use it wired or wireless. It is good to point out that when using wired the Bluetooth function basically turns itself off. If you're specifically looking for only wired headphones, the quality of the only wired versions (available in Mint Green and Blue) is equally good. The only wired versions also have the same push button on one of the earcups for play/pause and skipping songs. Unfortunately, the product description on Amazon can be a bit confusing because the Blue and Mint Green models are listed as having wireless or Bluetooth capabilities, but they do not. If you're looking for the wireless version, it is only available in black.All in all, I recommend these headphones.",the United States,True,20,R5H398OJD0O4K,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Amazing features and sound for a low price",5.0,Amy Dewan,2024-05-16,"So for starters i have a small head and small ears. Ive loved skullcandy for a while.  Each previous pair has lasted me a few years-- much longer than more expensive headphones.  I'm also partial to how they fold up,  i think this is maybe why they last longer. Just a theory though. Anyway,  the sound of these is great, it's clear and balanced. The overdrive volume is easy to use and it's nice to have a reminder that it could be set to a lower volume. The cups are comfortable,  the sound isn't compromised at all by the fact these are kids headphones. I love that these are bluetooth with an aux option,  usually a feature i only see in headphones at least twice the price. I'm also looking forward to listening to music w a friend with the additional aux. Walking around w a friend listening to the same music in our headphones sounds like it'll be really fun. Also just took a hifi vs lofi test in these and was able to tell what was hifi most of the time,  when they were plugged in and not even turned up to overdrive. This is why i love the aux option as well as bluetooth! Amazing thank you",the United States,True,9,R1WP3EZNDV8DXO,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

We turned the volume all the way up on the device and on the headphones, but I could barely hear. My other kid has a pair of Puro headphones. I got them on eBay for a great price 3 years ago. They sound great even with the volume limiter. I’m sorry I cheaped out and bought these. I would return them if the box wasn’t ripped. I’ll be eating the cost and forking out the cash for another pair of Puro. I’m glad they worked for others, but they did not work for me.

Wait for 14 days to get a confirmation on whether they will replace the product or not.INR 3998 wasted, feel cheated and harassed.What is surprising is that Amazon sold me a defective product and left me at the mercy of the reseller and vendor to sort an issue out.",India,True,13,RMAW7B7LDDFWR,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Everything but durability is great.",3.0,Farah,2025-06-26,"The quality of the headphones itself is great, the battery lasts A WHILE, its easy to use, and connectivity and sound quality are GREAT!! I've never had any issues with either. However, it isn't exactly the most durable. I've bought about three of these in three years, so it seems that if you're someone who'se going to use these in the gym or need to use them often for long hours they will probably break sooner than later. At one point my first pair stopped working on one side, the second's wire I  suppose was damaged? but regardless it caused issues with powering on and off the headphones, where at some point they wouldn't turn on at all. The third pair I'm sure will be the same, but I'm holding out hope. They are GREAT for their price and are genuinly good quality when looking at battery life, sound, and connectivity, but durability could use some work.",the United States,True,7,R4EUN92H40X0D,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

It only cancels computer sounds, clickings, rain noises and small things like that.I've heard people say it's comfortable, but it hurts my ears, the sides of my skull and the top of my head after wearing it for an hour.The sound quality, Talkthru feature and hearing your voice on calls are good.The ability to pair it with two devices simultaneously is very comfortable while working.In conclusion, with the same price, I think it's better to get higher quality, more lightweight and more comfortable headphones, without noise cancellation.",the United States,True,3,R2SRSXU2PCVZ16,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great bluetooth wireless headphones for tv, movies or the phone!",5.0,tarra byte,2025-04-27,"I added a bluetooth receiver to my older television and wanted headphones I could use while watching TV. My hearing is wrecked from all that loud rock n roll so wearing headphones while watching tv or movies has become a necessity. The way movies and tv sound goes from a whisper to loud, to crashing, to a whisper. My ears just can't decipher it all. But with the headphones I can hear everything, and I can get up and grab a snack without wires. This solution is working well and bonus, you can also use it with your phone if you pair it. Sources say, the sound was fine. Battery life is very good, meaning I charge for a couple hours every day, but I haven't run out of battery while talking on the phone or watching tv.  The controls are small but you learn what's what. I could see Sasquatch maybe having trouble with the small controls, but I think most humans can use them with a little practice.  I paired these headphones with a wireless bluetooth receiver I got for my television since it doesn't have built in bluetooth. The headphones are comfortable, light and fit well. They don't slide down after a while, they stay put. Very happy for the overall usefulness and quality for the value.",the United States,True,15,R1TIJDQXT8AV61,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

They're comfortable, provide reasonable sound quality and noise cancellation, and the equalizer can be tuned via an app. At under $30, I would definitely recommend giving them a try.- Sound Quality -I was impressed by the sound quality using the stock settings. The bass is slightly boosted by default, though it isn't blown out and doesn't overpower the mids and highs, which both come across clearly. If you aren't a fan of the defaults, though, then you can adjust the equalizer using an app to fit your tastes, a nice extra feature that I'm glad budget brands are starting to implement. It should be noted that these headphones do not support LDAC, if that's important to you.- Active Noise Cancellation -The ANC on these is decent, but nothing to write home about. It's togged by a dedicated button on the side of the headphones, next to the volume control. I felt moderate pressure in my ears when I wasn't playing music, but not to an uncomfortable degree. By itself, the ANC does a decent job of filtering out static and low-frequency noise, like running fans, but less-so other dynamic sounds, like the neighbor's music or people talking. While playing music, though, I wasn't bothered either by outside noise or the pressure on my inner ears. Overall, the ANC is adequate, but these might not be the best choice if you're specifically looking for headphones with great ANC.- Comfort -These headphones fit very well, and the cushions feel very nice on both my ears and the top of my head. Notably, I found that I could wear these comfortably even while wearing (small hoop) earrings, which is usually something I have trouble with. They aren't the tightest - you likely couldn't wear these while jogging, not that you'd want to with this type of headphone... - but for sitting at a desk or a casual walk these will work well. Overall I'm very impressed by how comfortable these are.- Functionality -One of my pet peeves is loud, intrusive voices when you use the controls on headphones - instead, these use mild tones to announce power on/off and successful pairing. Turning on and off ANC does have a voice, but it's not overly loud and doesn't stop or silence your music, just briefly lowers the volume. Earlier I mentioned app control - on Android the app is fairly glitchy with a lot of UI issues, including some elements blocked by the nav bar, but I was able to do everything I needed to despite this. The app does prompt you to create an account, but this is optional. Lastly, the controls on the headphones were a bit odd - the volume up and down positions were the opposite of where I expected them to be - but once you get used to them it's easy and fast to do all of the main functions, like ANC, play/pause, skipping, and volume changes. Volume can be adjusted quickly, since those buttons do not share a quick-press functionality; skipping is done by holding rather than a double press, which I appreciate.",the United States,False,0,R3BU48LLOCL0PQ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

It comes with a charging cord, and a plug-in cord if you don’t want to use Bluetooth and still have a jack. It was super easy to connect via Bluetooth to my iPhone and the music quality was quite good. The instructions do tell you to download their app if you want to use all the functionality and play with the sound settings, but I really hate extra apps on my phone, so I did not do that.

These are good headphones, not great headphones; features include phone calls",4.0,pandr,2025-06-22,"The box comes with everything you need to function with these headphones: charging cord, audio jack, manual, app setup brochure, and warranty card. The warranty covers defects from one year from original purchase. I charged the headphones before using them. You do not need the app to connect to your bluetooth device (phone or computer) to use the headphones. If wanted, the app adds additional features like equalizer settings. The headphones are lightweight. There is no clear indication which way to wear the headphones, although from the angle of the earpads, the controls earpad would be on the left. As for the fit, the headband is a little loose on me and fits my adult son using the extension; the earpads fit comfortably for me and are too small for my adult son’s ears—they compress his larger ears and he needs to take them off periodically to relieve the pressure. The earpads fold in the headband to be compact for storage. When folding the earpads in, the hinge sounds like it is breaking every time, which is unsettling to me. The earpads do not turn sideways, which means they do not lay flat against your chest when carrying around the neck. The pads on the earpads are fairly soft. The power button, also known as the multi-function button (MFB) turns the headphones on or off with a long press. There is an increasing pitch sound with a “pop” for “on” and a decreasing pitch sound ending in a “pop” sound for “off”. Then there are +/- buttons to control volume. Finally, there is the mode button which turns noise cancelling on or off. I have been using the headphones without the app, and the audio is satisfactory. When I turn noise cancelling (ANC) on, the background noise is reduced and still noticeable enough to have awareness of my surroundings; the thing I don’t like is that the volume of what I’m listening to increases. Another thing I don’t like is that the headphones do not maintain ANC status. When the headphones are turned off, the noise cancelling is turned off; you need to turn it back on every time. An additional useful feature is that you can use the headphones for phone calls. If the headset is connected to your phone and a call comes in, what you are listening to will pause and you will hear the “ring” through the headset. You can answer by short press of the MFB (power button) or if you answer via your phone, you will need to change the “audio” to reconnect the call through the headset. Either way, the call can be fully conducted through the headset. There is no indication of how much charge is left. I did not track the exact time, but my perception is that the charge does not last long—I think a few days when the headphones were not in use. This is made in China. Overall, these headphones are a mix of useful functions and so-so quality, with decent audio. You’ll have to weigh the features with how they might fit you with the cost to decide if they are right for you.",the United States,False,1,R2W3KJTW91XS6M,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Good budget headphones with usable ANC",4.0,TheTJ,2025-06-11,"The box contains the headphones, a USB-C to USB-A charging cable, and a male to male 3.5mm stereo wire.  My headphones came with about a 70% charge out of the box, so I immediately tried them out.  Audio quality is decent, but definitely a little muddy especially in the mids and highs.  Their app does have an EQ that you can use to tune them to your preferences, but when trying to use a custom EQ, the sound output was greatly reduced, even with everything increased to max, which makes that basically worthless and you're forced to use one of the presets.  I prefer the Jazz or Blue presets.  I did not test call quality. Audio Quality - 6/10Build quality seems decent, not too heavy and aren't too tight so you should be able to wear them for a long time without issue.  The faux leather ear cups are comfortable and don't trap in heat, even when I was using them while mowing my lawn.  Unfortunately they don't seem to be removable or replaceable so you're stuck with them.  They can fold up to make them slightly easier to pack into a backpack, but the ear cups don't rotate, so they won't pack flat. Build quality - 7/10Feature wise, this does what you expect from it but does include the ability to pair to 2 devices at once, which I didn't test.  The physical buttons (power, volume -/+) allow you to control your media: pause (short press power button), skip (long press + volume) and rewind media (long press - volume), as well as a dedicated button to enable ANC.  Everything you need but that's it.  7/10Battery life seems pretty good so far.  After about 2 hours of use with ANC on, it's showing 90% battery remaining.  They advertise 50 hours of use, but based on my usage, ANC will probably reduce that to 20 hours or so, but it should still last long enough for most tasks or flights before needing to be recharged.Some parts of the Havit app were in Chinese which required me to run a screenshot through Google Translate. Skip the app unless you want to use a different EQ.  That's about all the app is useful for.",the United States,False,3,R1Q8ND3H886RME,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

They are comfortable to wear, and I think they'll be a great multipurpose set of headphones. As with many less-expensive noise-cancelling headphones, I feel like the ANC is decent but not outstanding. If you're looking to erase all environmental sound, you'll probably need to spend more. But these do cancel out some sound. They've paired smoothly. Only time will tell how they last, but early signs are positive. This seems like a pretty solid value.

light bluetooth headphones with poor audio quality and ANC",1.0,Barefoot Birdie,2025-05-29,"First, the audio quality is pretty awful for music. I compared it to various other headphones, both fully-enclosed like these, as well as on-ear earbuds. The Havit headphones sounded the worst. The music was muddy and muffled, and just sounded bad. I tested them both via bluetooth and wired. In all cases, the Havit headphones sounded quite bad.For active noise cancelling, I compared it to two other ANC headphones and only the Havit produced a constant hiss, as well as failed to block the nearby computer fan noises the other headphones were able to block. Granted, the others were in a higher price bracket.The controls are confusing, especially with the diagram showing them flipped around instead of in the orientation you see when you look at the headphones normally. The control buttons are also difficult to tell apart, and I kept confusing the power and bluetooth pairing buttons, for example. They need to be better distinguished by touch, and the markings more clear.When unfolding, there's a sharp ""click"", but given their light weight it feels like you're about to break them each time they're opened.They are light and quite comfortable, with padding that's easy on the ears, and inexpensive.

Headphones arrived and immediately felt super cheap and flimsy, like the band could snap under light pressure. I only received one cord which was supposed to be both the charging and connection cord. The cord was super short and only had a USB-A&C connections which made it unusable to connect to my PC desktop (monitors don't connect to USB-A and the only port I could use wouldn't be possible since the cable is so short).

Headband fit so poorly that it caused an actual bald spot on my scalp",2.0,Eliza,2025-05-06,"Buyer beware: the headband is much wider than previous models. Edifier has been my go-to for headphones for many years now, but these dudes are going back to Amazon. I loved my previous pair, W800BT Plus, and I was sad when the sound quality in one of the earphones suddenly noticeably degraded. I was even more sad when I went looking to replace them and found that they no longer sell them. So I picked these ones instead.My first complaint is that Edifier no longer seems to make any over-ear headphones that are corded, except with USB cords that are much too short. The W800BT Plus has an optional 3.5mm cord. It was nice to be able to use one pair of headphones for devices that didn't have Bluetooth or USB as well as ones that do. But by far the bigger (literally) problem is that the new headbands are so large and wide, that they only stayed on my head by sitting on one small point at the top of my head. I tried to give them a shot and just get used to it, even tried padding them out, but they're simply too wide. After a while it started to hurt, and today I looked at the spot in the mirror to find I now have a noticeable BALD SPOT where the headphones have been sitting. Well, that's it. I tried them for a month, but I draw the line at any product causing bald spots on my scalp.I messaged Edifier to ask if any of the other models have smaller headbands, and they said no. I'm extremely disappointed to have to abandon my favorite audio brand. Outside of the size and my minor pet peeve with the cord, the quality is as good as ever, which is why I'm still giving 2 stars. But I'm not going to buy from Edifier again until they offer smaller and narrower headband sizes again. Maybe they need to make an option for small or large headbands. For now I'll just have to find a second-hand pair of the W800BT Plus, if I can.",the United States,True,0,RVE9Y4GP8L1L4,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Dreamy Headphones",5.0,d.deven,2025-03-20,"I love how comfortably these headphones are made. The earpads are wide enough my ears fit inside so if I end up falling asleep with them on - I don't wake up with a migraine and ear pain. Furthermore, the cushion around the ear helps to filter out background noise which adds to the noise-cancelling feature. The cushion at the top of the headset also fits nicely and doesnt cause a dent with long-term use. My other headphones are supposed to be higher quality, they are heavier and I can only wear them for no longer than a couple hours. These ones I have LITERALLY fallen asleep in and woken up with no indentations, and no pain. The battery life is great as well! they are sitting at 40% right now, I have not charged them yet since I pulled them out of the box - so they have been on for a full 8-9 hours each night, plus roughly 2-4 hours a day depending on my work requirements. They are pretty easy to switch between devices, you just hold down the ""on"" button for roughly six seconds when turning them on. it skips pairing with the last device you connected them to and allows you to pair with another. Definitly recommend. connected to my phone I can use the app that comes recommended with it and turn the noise cancelling on and off, include background noise like rain, waves etc. and change how I hear music by switching from classical, to rock, to pop and a few others.",the United States,True,4,R1DJLPDIQDYC8M,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Decent sound quality, deeply flawed, zero customer service",2.0,Greg,2025-02-19,"These headphones had good ANC and sound quality.  I work in a noisy environment and wore them mostly for noise cancellation, with ambient music playing at a low volume.After a few months of use, they started to randomly disconnect from the Bluetooth source and emit a loud (2-3x the selected volume), painful feedback noise for several minutes before restarting and reconnecting. The controls were unresponsive during these episodes - you just had to let it happen. This happened once or twice a day and the sound was bad enough to exacerbate my tinnitus and cause pain for several minutes.I tried to get support through Edifier.... crickets. So, I tried to initiate a return through Edifier. I received no response from the company whatsoever.I continued to risk using them until recently when the thin plastic holding the ear cups to the headband broke while I was adjusting them.

The app they use also kind of sucked because your setting would never save, meaning you would have to go into the app and manually change them every time.Overall they were pretty good, HOWEVER only days after getting them, they broke. I was sitting in the car with the window rolled down and the noise cancelling turned on and the microphone on the outside of the earcup glitched out. This glitch cause the head phones to send a very loud and high pitched ring through the earcup which cause me to go temporarily deaf in my ear.

Good value for the money",4.0,Nobody,2025-09-16,"*UPDATE*WARNING: These do NOT come with a USB dongle like most wireless headphones do, so if your machine doesn't have Bluetooth, you're out of luck.My initial impressions after 1 day of use.Build: mid grade, probably won't stand up to any kind of abuseAudio quality: good, default is bass heavy so audiophiles will probably play with the EQ immediately, but other use cases will like itMicrophone: It works fine, nothing to write home aboutComfort: I wore it for 8hrs straight no problems. It got a bit warm, but not too bad. I was fine wearing it for the dayCables: LOL they don't deserve the name. They are literally about 6"" long. The company was just checking a box when they included them. Nobody is going to use these. They fully expect you to use your phone or game device's USB-C charging cable / audio connectorNoise cancelling: For clarification, this reduces the sound of talking, not all noise. It doesn't eliminate the talking either, I can still hear people talking around me at work with it on, it just doesn't distract me as much. You'll want Bose or something if you really want noise cancelling, but for reducing office noise at work they're fineBattery life: I only used it for 8hrs straight, but the battery was still ""high"" at the endCharging speed: very fast (1hr to full)Recommendation: These are ideal for people that want to listen to music at work and reduce (not eliminate) office noise. They are also good for gamers.

Above average noise canceling, I question the build quality",3.0,kshudson,2025-09-09,"I purchased this based on the nytimes wire cutter article that recommended these as the best budget option. My experience was that the noise cancelling was average to above average and was a big improvement over the noise cancelling I experienced with an older version of Beats Studio pro 3 headphones and also a pair of beats earbuds. In an open office floor setting, the headphones blocked out a significant amount of the conversations happening around me and I was able to focus on my work. I ultimately ended up returning it for two reasons 1) because the build quality of the headphones wasn’t as high as I expected.  It feels a little flimsy compared to my older beats headphones and I was already noticing some discoloration on the ear pads after the first day 2) from a style standpoint they are larger and bulkier and I felt a little uncomfortable wearing themI do think they’re a good value for the money and my daughter liked them enough that I bought a pair for her.

Faulty headphones but good customer service",3.0,Erika M Blomdahl,2025-09-01,"These headphones look sleek but the sound quality is awful. There is this glitchy sound that distorts music that occurs very frequently. It's like that sound when you are starting to get too far out of range with bluetooth headphones, except that I am sitting right at the computer my headphones are paired to so it's not a distance problem. I've tried removing and repairing but it doesn't fix it. I don't know if I just have a dud? My headphones did seem used when they arrived (some scratches and markings), but I don't mind a gently used item if it still works normally so I just accepted that. At first the distortion sound was every couple songs and was easy-ish to ignore, but it's gotten so much worse lately, now it's every 15-30 secs, which renders these headphones actually unusable to me it's so annoying.UPDATE: customer service was helpful and responsive to resolve the matter, so I am revising my review to reflect that although the headphones I have don't work well the customer service was solid.

Great sounding headphones with one problem",3.0,JBH,2025-08-28,"These are the best-sounding Bluetooth headphones I've owned, especially with the LDAC code enabled. The noise cancellation also works very well, though I miss the touch sensor for activating transparency that my old SoundCore headphones had. There is, however, one problem I'm having. I think having a recessed power button or some way of protecting the button may have been a better design choice. These headphones have repeatedly turned themselves on in my bag without warning. If I don't notice that they've connected to my phone, they can very quickly drain their own batteries, depriving me of the ability to use them.",the United States,True,6,R33MCLJCKYN8FR,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

When you turn them on, if fully charged, they say ""Battery High""",5.0,Russ,2025-08-23,"The instructions say to charge at not more than 5 V.  I figured Anker charger, Anker headphones, they'd negotiate the charging.  Every time I turned them on, they said (I thought) ""battery hot.""  I left them overnight, and tried the next day and still got that every time I turned them on.I talked to Amazon support and said that they must be defective, and arranged an exchange with no problem.The new ones showed up, I charged them on  a less than 5 V charger, and got the same problem.It turns out that the headphones can verbally report the battery charge level when you turn them on.  They have the totally normal thing to say when the battery is fully charged: ""battery high.""  They have another message if there is a battery problem: ""battery hot.""  Unfortunately, the message isn't clear enough for my ears to have made the distinction.I feel bad that I exchanged a perfectly good headphone (that will probably go into the trash)  for another one.I have barely had time to use them, but noise cancellation seems really good.

My XM4's died at 13 months,  just out of warranty. Both ear cups snapped off the headrest, and the ANC failed and would contantly feedback, making them unwearable. These Soundcore's are bassier,  with a more dynamic and louder soundscape than the Sony's. And the Ap allows for ultimate customization. The ANC is much cleaner and you don't get that tin can sound in the Soundcore's.

It is more complete for its price",5.0,Erick,2025-08-20,"Personally, I consider these headphones to be the best for under $100. In terms of construction, they feel very good, despite being made of plastic, it is a good quality plastic with an excellent finish and also with excellent padding. In fact, I think they are some of the most comfortable headphones I have tried and comparable to high-end headphones from Sony. They can be used for hours and the truth is that they do not bother at all. The floating axis makes them fit very well in the ears, without a doubt, this is one of their strong points. Another point that is comparable to Sony headphones is some lifestyle functions, such as pausing a video or music as soon as you remove the headphones or playing them as soon as you put them on since they have a proximity sensor. Another very good feature is being able to activate ambient mode by simply placing your hand on the left earbud or also activating ambient mode just by starting to speak. The noise cancellation is automatically deactivated and reactivates when you stop speaking for about 4 seconds. Great!!  These ""lifestyle"" features didn't seem useful to me at first, but if you're someone who uses them outdoors, like on the street or while traveling, they're features that make your life easier when having a conversation with someone. I've only seen these features in some Sony products. In terms of noise cancellation, they perform well for their price. I don't think there's currently any headphone that cancels 100% noise, not even the Sony ones, which are the best in this regard. Their app is great; I'd say one of the best. It's very intuitive and highly configurable, especially the ""HearID"" audio setup feature. The audio is good; I'd say it's not their strongest point, but if you're someone who can use an equalizer, you can significantly improve the sound from the app. Their charging time and battery life are good, as is their design; they're very aesthetic and modern.  I think the only thing missing was a hard case, as it comes with a cloth bag (very nice and good quality), but considering the price and all the features of the headphones, I don't know if that would be a negative point. Overall, I think it was a good buy for $100 or even less, as there are other brands like QCY or SOUNDPEATS, but these Soundcore headphones are the most complete, definitely a good purchase.",the United States,True,5,R18IZ7SDGQD5MJ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

MY FAVORITE HEADPHONES OF ALL TIME! ❤️",5.0,Ehren,2025-08-13,"I don't leave reviews too often. Most of the time, I just simply don't want to make the effort.. HOWEVER, after using these, I simply HAD to leave a review for these beauties! HOLY MOLY these babies are AWESOME!!! 🎧 The aesthetic is gorgeous.. sleek, modern, soft, & veryyy comfortable (there's this super comfy memory foam type stuff on the underside part that touches your head). Also, they are insanely USER FRIENDLY, in my opinion. Nothing complicated about them at all. 📦 When opening the headphones, I cut the tape on each side, slid the interior box out, took the headphones out, grabbed & then opened the instruction manual, easily located the ""pair headphones"" section, & literally with the click of 1 button on the headset and 1 button on my TV, they connected instantly.. & they now connect automatically each time. 💗I absolutely LOVE the setting where you can take the headphones off to talk to someone & it automatically pauses your show (The Guilded Age) and then when you're done talking to that person, you put them back on & it automatically starts your show back up again. ⏯️ It seems they've thought of everything!Another thing I'm extremely impressed with is the Noise Cancelling button on the headset. The difference between the ""Transparency"" (hearing outside noises in addition to whatever you're listening to) option and the ""Noise Cancelling"" (only hearing whatever you're listening to) option is PHENOMENAL! My father has the blue Space One's, while I have the beige. The colors of the headphones match the pictures perfectly-🎨! The Noise Cancelling option works so well that if my father has them on, I must tap him or stand in his line of sight (waving like a crazy person) if I want to get his attention! Oh, and the battery life of these puppies is on point!🩷 The price isn't ""cheap"", but is WELL WORTH what you get in return. It's relative of course, but to me,100 bucks really isn't that bad- especially with the cost of things nowadays and the quality you get in return!♥️So, in conclusion: When thinking of each aspect of the headphones overall, I can easily & certainly say THESE ARE QUALITY HEADPHONES & if you're on the fence about which headphones to purchase with your hard earned money, these will not let you down!😄🥰",the United States,True,12,R3LSZ3QJZBK20Z,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great Sound. Non-Existent Noise Cancellation.",2.0,Nicole A.,2025-08-06,I’ve had Soundcore Life 30 for 3 years. I needed new headphones once the ear muff pleather started falling f apart. I saw that Space One is suppose to be the same but better. Not at all. Sound quality is wonderful and better than Life 30. With great sound quality noise cancellation is non-existent. With Life 30 I could block out sirens on the streets and loud snoring in the house. With Space One headphones is a no. For me Life 30 sound quality is less I rather have great noise cancellation. Disappointed that these are suppose to be better (and more expensive) than Soundcore Life 30.

Good but doesn't cancel enough noise for me.",4.0,Olivia,2025-08-05,"The headphones are comfortable and the audio is good enough. They block out some sound which is good for general use. Took off a star because the noise reduction is insufficient if you really need external sounds blocked out. I could still hear everything going on around me and pull apart individual sounds without straining to hear. Definitely needed to focus to be able to hear someone talking but could understand them well with the headphones on. The earpads and head rest part were pretty comfortable and I didn't feel like my head was being squeezed or like the headphones were going to fall off.I like how they collapse down a bit for easier storage. They come with a little dust cover which is nice. I used them once but ultimately decided to return them because I need a higher level of noise cancellation than these provide. I attempted to use the ANC setting but there was no discernable difference between standard mode and ANC in further reducing the sounds I needed blocked out. On max volume I wasn't able to hear my audiobook over the external noise. To be fair, I tested them running some sapele through a jointer which is a very loud environment and not something that most people are likely to experience. Would recommend them for the average person but not for someone who is trying to work in a loud shop environment and block out louder external sounds.",the United States,True,0,R1VIL9GJE27LO8,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THEM...",3.0,Ryan B.,2025-09-17,"First off, this set of headphones has SOOO much going for them and i feel guilty saying anything bad about them except this flaw is irredeemable. I bought this set in preparation for an international trip.First off, the Pros:1. Form factor and layout: The swivel and the hinged ends means it takes as little space possible when folded. I LOVE the very clear L and R markings, why doesn't anyone else do this? Button placement is adequate once you're used to it.2. Audio quality is quite good, I didn't put them through ALL the paces but for the cost the performance is great! Noise cancelling is excellent and one thing many don't report on is that the MICROPHONE quality is excellent as well and has background noise cancellation built in as well. That was my biggest complaint with my previous Sony headset was the Mic quality for phone calls.3. I think it's a good value for the money with the exception of the one big con below.Now to the unforgivable con for me- COMFORTIt is SOOOO close but the earpads are just a hair too small so that no matter how much i try, my medium sized ears will not fit fully inside of these, which causes extra pressure on the one part of my ear that won't fit inside. It's very easy to see once you hold this headset in your hand even before putting them on!It FEELS totally fine when you first put them on but tat around the 45-60min mark a hotspot on the fronts of my ears just suddenly appears making it unbearable to wear any longer.When i travel i plan to use them for the whole flight and all day when I'm working. In fact, I have a Poly Voyager Focus 2 headset that doesn't cup at all and just goes right on top of the whole ear that i can tolerate for longer than these.Sad to say these have so much going for them and I was looking forward to using them to cancel out the airplane noise without having to crank the volume up on some earbuds and cause hearing damage.",the United States,True,0,R1AWID06IRW9CU,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Cheap quality, low sound quality for price, app needed, noise canceling is not great.",1.0,Amazon Customer,2025-07-25,"Got these as a gift in January. They sucked from day 1. The noise canceling is mediocre and comparable to other cheaper brands, some cheaper brands being better. When using them on heavy equipment, you get a loud humming sound, so bad that they're not even usable on loud equipment. And now, about 6 months later they just stopped working.  Worked fine the other night when I turned them off. Went to use them today and they will turn on and say ""connected"" twice, once for Bluetooth and once for the app. No audio at all will come out of them. The app won't let me update software because it says there's a currenct call going on which obviously there is not. You can't do much with these without downloading an app and dealing with app updates and software updates. I won't buy another set of jbl's. Garbage product. You can easily spend half the amount on some soundcores or pretty much any other knock off and have a longer lasting, equally as good sounding headphone. Also, these don't get nearly loud enough.

As soon as I started using them I knew I made the right choice.  I really like the noise cancelling as my house is noisy with fans and an ac unit running. I like that I can turn them on noise cancelling without music and enjoy some quite time.  It paired with my phone very quickly and offers much more functionality than other brands by using the JBL app.  Overall very happy!,the United States,True,1,R3GEBI3CH3CAY5,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Long lasting battery Great sound and noise cancellation",5.0,Brian Mason,2025-07-09,Lightweight and the sound is great. Noise canceling is 100%. Put a full charge on them and used for over 5 hours and still has 90% charge on them. Clarity is great and exactly what you expect from JBL products. They fit nice and very easy to use.I use these on average 5-6 hours a week and after 51 days I just got the battery is low alert.

Not durable AT ALL. Coming apart after less than a year.",2.0,L. Anderson,2025-07-04,"Noise quality was good and they are fairly comfortable. Noise cancellation was decent, but annoying that you have to go into the app to actually turn it off. The physical noise cancellation button on the headphones only toggles between “noise canceling” and “ambient aware” and the ambient aware setting is AWFUL!! It’s makes a bunch of static-y and fuzzy sounds over your music or audio. If that was the only problem though, they’d be a solid 4 star pair of headphones, but unfortunately they also are just not durable. After only 6-7 months, the material covering the ear padding started peeling off badly. (I don’t even use these heavily, since I have a different pair of headphones I use more.) The fabric really should be stitched or glued down MUCH better. For the price this is embarrassingly low build quality…",the United States,True,0,R1CUOJD92L6QH,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Highly recommended but ear cushions are tad small",5.0,Steven,2025-06-30,"Very high quality with excellent sound quality. Very long battery life and charge very quickly. Lightweight and very compact.  Easy to pair with phone or other devices such as ipods. Appreciate the buttons vs. touchpad for volume adjustment, rewind and fast forward. Sound canceling is better than average. JBL app is great and has a built in equalizer as well as being able to adjust right/left balance which few headphones can do. Also has various sound shapes and bass boast. Deep clean bass is better than most, excellent as is the entire range. The only drawback is that I wish the headphone cushions, while comfortable,  would be a tad bit larger. And I have somewhat small ears. Even though I've used these on international flights, after about 3  hours, they become a bit uncomfortable. Not sweaty, just uncomfortable.  Overall, all things considered,  I woud highly recommend these headphones.",the United States,True,29,RW89ZAOY98888,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Perfect School Headphones for Preteens",5.0,Ange,2025-09-15,"I got these headphones for my child based on their school supply list, and they turned out to be the perfect option. The design is neutral enough to work for either a boy or a girl, which is great when shopping for something that needs to fit school guidelines.What I really love is the premium, minimalist aesthetic. It looks sleek and stylish, which my preteen really appreciates—it doesn’t feel overly “kiddie” or too grown-up. The build feels solid, and the sound quality is very clear for both listening and speaking through the microphone.They’ve been ideal for schoolwork, online classes, and even casual music or gaming at home. The wired design makes them simple to use—no need to worry about pairing or charging—and they’ve held up well so far with daily use.Overall, these headphones are a practical, stylish, and affordable choice for any student.

I like the color of it. I chose purple. As for durability, I'll see how long it lasts. I accidentally dropped them off of my desk and nothing broke, so that's good.

The foldable design is also a plus for portability. They work great with my laptop and tablet via the standard 3.5mm plug.They’re not noise-canceling and the bass is a bit light, but for casual use, they’re more than enough.

I spend more time rewinding, trying to figure out what I missed, than studying. Reddit recommended turning off the multipoint on the app, connecting to only one device at a time, being close to the device, and even blowing in the microphones on each headphone. None of that has worked for me. My AirPods work better, sadly. I wouldn't be as annoyed if they weren't so expensive! I got them during Prime Day, and they were still $200.

Bose VS Sennheiser",5.0,R.C.,2025-09-14,"I recently had to retire my Sennheiser PXC 550 after years of reliable use. Since they no longer make that model and I don't like the new Momentums, I started looking at other brands. So lets compare them:Senn's have a WAY more neutral sound signature and natural sound overall. The Bose in comparison produces insane amounts of bass. It muddies up the mids and highs quite a bit. I lowered the bass by about 7db and it sounds ok now. The reason I ended up getting the Bose is not for sound quality, but for practicality while traveling. They are very light weight, comfortable on the head and the travel case takes up less space in my carry on luggage than any other brand I considered. Noise cancelling is totally adequate. There is better noise cancelling available at this point since this model is not the newest, but I don't think the extra money is worth the marginal improvements you'd get. So, if you are looking for headphones to really dive into your favorite music, don't buy these. If you're looking for the perfect travel headphone to block noise on an airplane, casually listen to some music and watch movies on the plane while fading in and out of consciousness during a 14 hour flight....buy these!",the United States,True,1,R5W4ZGROROKX9,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Highly overrated - don't waste your money",1.0,TAM48,2025-09-10,"Mediocre is being kind. I always thought Bose products had good noise cancelling abilities. This one is only capable of reducing sound by about five decibels. On the subway when I have the Quiet Mode (highest level of noise cancelling), I can hear the wheels of the subway train squealing, other people's conversations, opening and closing door alarms, and all other manner of noise clearly. Total waste of money since I know I can get better noise cancelling capabilities in head phones for a fraction of the price. Volume control is not very good either - it's either too loud or too soft. No way to adjust any better. I tried to give it a chance but now I can't return it.

Poor quality, poor customer service",1.0,Celeste Woerner,2025-08-31,"I’m a dog groomer. A fellow dog groomer recommended these to cancel noise from the salon. That aspect worked just fine for me. HOWEVER within a few I had connectivity issues where it would lose connection and randomly from aware to quiet to aware. I went through Bose directly for the warranty replacement which is about a 3-4 weeks turnaround btw…. New ones seemed to be working great, good sound good noise cancelling UNTIL one day my audiobook got quieter and quieter. Thought maybe I bumped my phone or smart watch but nope. The headphones were just turning it down completely unbidden. The buttons on the actual headphones were working so I used my phone and literally watched the volume go up as I pressed my phone buttons and slide right back down. Extremely frustrating as I work in a mobile van and it can be kind of lonely without a book or podcast going. Turned it on and off multiple times, reset it, disconnected from my phone and reconnected. Everything. After awhile I’d try again and it’d work for a bit but inevitably the problem would repeat itself. Perhaps some dust or humidity or sweat got inside it I don’t know but at $300+ I feel like they should be a bit more durable…. At this point I didn’t want them anymore. I wanted my money back and a different brand all together that would hold up a little better for my work. Customer service was awful. All they’re willing to do is send a replacement pair of the same crappy quality headphones that will inevitably break again. Not worth the money or hassle.",the United States,False,0,R21DCR3YUWVT1D,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

When I first took them out, I liked they way they looked and Philips is a well known brand. I also liked the fact that I could connect the headphones with two different jacks. What I wasn’t prepared for was the extremely long cord!! I’ve never owned headphones like this. I can walk to another bedroom and not tug on the cord. I took a close look at the box and it says TV listening 6m. That’s 6 meters! I didn’t want TV headphones, but that’s what I was sent. I looked back on the product page and the video even says 2m. That would have been better. I guess in the bright side is that I can walk around my office room and have enough cord to walk around. The sound quality is decent.

There were a couple of songs where it was a little 'crackly' in my ears, but both these and the Rumoon did it to be honest.  The volume is definitely lower on these than on the Rumoon.  I don't like exceptionally loud noises anyway, so with the headphones all the way up and my phone volume all the way up, it was still comfortably loud.  It would probably be too low for a lot of people.  It is a nice feature that the cord is Really long, like super long, and there's volume control right on the cord.It was a really hard decision for me which set to go with, but ultimately, I prefer the bass being a bit more pronounced, which makes the music feel more immersive to me.",the United States,True,1,R1BXT3UNYR64C6,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Negatives - sound reproduction very heavily weighted toward bass (fine if listening to music with strong bass content) but not so beneficial when listening to classical music (my normal music is church pipe organ and especially a Cavaille-Coll  organ 32 foot contre-bombard stop at 16cps is nearly overwhelming) and the double lanyard line cord from headphones to volume control is more entangling than the single line cord on other phones which I have.",the United States,True,0,R2ZUS0AK6AZ5XH,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Very uncomfortable",2.0,Carter S,2025-06-08,"These are listed as over ear headphones. One would expect them to completely cover your ears. However, the ear cups are very small, so my earlobes poke out the bottom. The tilt of the earcups cannot be adjusted, and as such, they leave a big gap at the back of my ears. Usually the top of my outer ears won’t fit inside either. This makes them more like on-ear headphones, they are very uncomfortable.I have a big head, but that shouldn’t matter.The way these are designed, the earcups are very easy to pull off, and hard to put back on. I initially thought you had to jam it back into the tiny gap they attach through. I was wrong!You can actually CAREFULLY pry out the part holding the speaker. It’s just got some clips then it pops out. You can then stretch the earcup back over the plastic piece, seat it on some pegs, and snap the whole thing back into place.Do be careful, the wires that attach to the speaker driver are thin and could break off.Onto the positives: They’re a good price if the aforementioned flaws were fixed. I’m almost tempted to glue different ear cups onto these.The sound quality of these is pretty good! They’ve got a lot more highs compared to my previous headphones which I now realize sound muddy in comparison.The cord is very long, longer than I need it to be, so I wrapped up the excess with rubber bands.The headband has very minimal padding, but that’s not really an issue, as the support comes from the ear pads, not the top of the head.They do not fold or swivel in any way, which is a downside for fit, comfort and portability. However, they are tilted, which is nice.",the United States,False,0,RLTXJW6NJH9EP,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Sadly, foam earpiece covers come off with slightest touch, rendering headphones useless!",1.0,Allan F. Eddy,2025-05-17,"I originally wrote a favorable review for these headphones; however, as my wife was packing a suitcase, she asked me, ""What is this piece of foam?"" Unfortunately, I didn't know what the foam was that she was asking about, so I told her to just throw it away...oops...mistake! On later examination I found it to be one of the foam earpiece covers, and I discovered both earpiece foam pieces were so susceptible to coming off that a simple bump of any type would dislodge them, so they would fall off. Due to an inadequately deep groove designed into the earpiece, the foam cover does not have a deep enough trough, or valley, to sink into, so it comes off extremely easily. Now I have no usable headphones. I'm surprised Phillips allowed such a flaw in their product.

These will wear out and break with in 3 years its not and if but when.The plastic that is the headband is not good and breaks happen near the slide adjustment arm. Best bet is to set the size you want and basically tape it solid or any other method to lock the arms solid in place to the rest of the plastic. The other thing is the cable is ungodly long and non detachable and the cables go into each speaker separately.

Weak audio and a too-small size",1.0,Marshal,2025-04-22,"These headphones are lightweight, but that's about all that's going for them.The sound quality however leaves a bit to be desired: the bass really feels lackluster.Comfort-wise, these don't really fit to a head very well. The earcups are slightly rotated, so they can only fit in one direction on your head, which SHOULD improve ergonomics, but they still kinda place pressure on you if your head is at all larger. It *fits* but if you're like me you won't be able to wear them for very long like advertised. It's something you could probably get used to, but it's a major pain point for me.The cable is very long which at least is a plus, as so many headsets opt for a 3 ft cable it seems like. But, overall, this set of headphones falls far short of expectations.The packaging (which arrived crushed, by the way) also can't be opened without ripping the box, which seems like it will make returns a mess, if I try to return it.",the United States,True,3,RFWCVZA4ETQRI,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I was skeptical when I first saw this headset on Amazon.  I have run into other dealers why say no silicone but they do have silicone buds.  But after doing some research I felt comfortable enough to buy a set of these over the ear headphones.  I haven't regretted it and fully intend to buy another set and tuck them away for safe keeping.  Headsets don't last forever and I do not want to be without these if mine ever does.,the United States,True,0,R3LAFBCRS16TXM,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I have small ear holes and cannot wear wireless ear or even wired plugs, it has to be only via ear cover. I hate wearing heavy earphones. When over the ear came out --- before jog plug design --- game changer as even buds were a pain to deal with. I checked. This design should be a close match to the tie-in one I had. Absent some sparkle and upgrade materials, it's the same. The sound seemed decent enough. Function wise, the buds seemed too large and not as flexible to turn as the ones I had. And the over ear too small. Everything just pops off frequently. Sigh. Reminds me to always buy 2-3-lifetime amounts of things that seem designed for me.

The ear buds work great and sound quality is good enough for me.",5.0,Matthew H.,2024-05-28,"This is my second pair of this brand and style of ear buds.  The first pair were purchased more than 20 years ago because I had a sickly wife and son and was spending many hours in hospital waiting rooms.They don't block out all the ambient noise so I was still able to hear things going on around me and listen for my name being called.  Of course with the volume turned up they block everything out.  Certain songs like ""We Will Rock You"", ""Phantom of the Opera"" beg to be played at high volumes and these earbuds sound good to me.  They don't break up or get raspy and background hiss isn't noticeable.  They work great for YouTube videos and podcasts because the voice clarity is quite good.The earbuds have lasted through the days of portable CD players, to digital players similar to iPods to the port on my smart phone for listening to music.  The old pair still works well most of the time but was having problems related to a kitty tooth mark in the wire.I wanted the same kind of ear buds because they are most used when plugged into the headphone port of my desktop computer.  It's an old desktop and I didn't want to spend the money on Bluetooth or have to deal with charging the buds.  For my use these are simple and reliable.I used to use the ear buds while working out or walking and they tend to stay in place well.I think the sound quality of these is very good considering the cost.  They seem to have a fair range and music sounds good enough for me.",the United States,True,11,R1EKZQ41RZYU4T,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Out The Box, Ready To Go",5.0,Amazon Reviewer,2024-04-17,"I love products like this.Let's say you've got a family member who doesn't have the most updated technology. They're not rocking a Bluetooth or a 4K TV or anything like that. They've got your basic plug and play but they still like a little comfort and convenience. Well as someone who just went through it trying to find a way for them to enjoy listening to their TV through headphones when all else fails and all the other modern options don't work out this came through and saved the day.Nothing to install, transmit, or pair. Just open the box and pull out the headphones. I got the 19 foot option (which was MORE than enough room) and just had to unwind it and plug it in. BOOM. Insta-sound. Nothing to explain or have to struggle with. I just handed it to him and he was happy as a clam to be able to watch his sport's shows when the grand kids are napping without disturbing them.Perfect for our more low-tech relatives.",the United States,False,0,R1AK1Q1C4QTFIB,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Could use a bit more volume",4.0,Winchester2,2024-04-16,"These headphones work well enough to watch shows, movies and internet videos.  Dialogue is clear if there are only one or two people talking. If there’s background noise or others speaking around them, it can get a bit jumbled. I wouldn’t suggest these headphones for music. Once again, if the music is simple such as a single acoustic guitar playing, they aren’t bad, but the average pop or rock song sounds muddy and flat. Bass is basically non-existent.The headphones themselves are comfortable on the head. I don’t find them to be tight and I have a large head. The ear pieces are well padded and work well to block out surrounding noise.  The cord is very long, but you can keep the extra looped and tied like it arrives. I appreciate that the cord is straight and not one of those curly cords which can be annoying. There’s a volume control right on the cord, but the range seems extremely limited. I find with my computer at half volume, I hear just fine through the speakers. It’s actually a bit loud. I plug in the headphones and half volume doesn’t seem to be enough and I have to max the volume control on the headphones to equal what I heard through the speakers.

They seem soft cushions so should not be an issue. You can easily fit these on your head so that they stay put. They don’t have a mic but I knew that and don’t have a need.

Good for dialog and vocals",4.0,MGB,2024-04-02,"No idea if this the result of deliberate design decisions, or just a product of mid- to low-end components, but these headphones have a very specific audio presentation that emphasizes vocals, dialogue, and higher end frequencies. This makes them good for picking out dialog in TV watching, which, to be fair, seems to be the main thrust of the marketing. Especially for older folks whose hearing may not be what it used to be (and let's be honest, sound mixing in a lot of modern media is a mess). On the flipside, midrange is lacking, and bass is downright anemic. Take the marketing at face value -- there's probably a good reason that music is not referenced anywhere. In sum, these aren't as high fidelity as most of the other sets I've owned, but they didn't cost nearly as much either, and I've certainly heard worse.",the United States,False,0,R28BL155FMGMI,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The cord is about 9 feet long and straight. When I’m working at a desk, I don’t need a cord that curls back up on itself and tangles. This set of headphones is perfect for every day computer/TV use and is very comparable to others I’ve used in the past that have cost four times as much.

Lots of bass, no high end, decent comfort",2.0,Cable Master,2025-03-09,"I don't consider myself an audiophile. I do have a decent pair of headphones I use every day, but I can also be happy with a cheap pair of $30 headphones as long as they aren't the worst thing ever. Using these headphones is like standing outside of a club with a really good sound system. You can hear the music, but only the lower frequencies make it through the walls and all the highs are severely lacking. I didn't expect amazing results for $16 but even then, they are a little disappointing. Everything is very muffled. I will say that I like the design of them though. They have good padding, feel decently sturdy, and can fold up to save space. They also cup over your ears really well so it gives a better bass effect....again there's pretty much only bass. If you really don't care at all about sound quality then these will do the job. But if you want a cheap pair of headphones that will at least somewhat reproduce your music accurately, I would look elsewhere. From what I've heard and my own experiences, ear buds seem to give better value for money at the cheaper end, if you can put up with them.",the United States,False,1,R3UFLBD7KX0EDZ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

OK for rock/gaming; not ideal for female vocalists/classical",3.0,Intrepid,2025-03-06,"This is a review of a MIDOLA Wired Headphones with Microphone with 3.5mm jacks.  The headphones are nice in shape and color.  Can be collapsed and twisted so it takes up very little space - very packable.  The good is that the oval earphones are over-the-ear for kids (their models had slightly small ears or mine are big).  The ear pads appear non-replaceable, but at the price point probably not much an issue.The cord is braided nylon which is good since low priced headphones even by Turtle Beach have sometimes been brittle.  The problem is the strain relief close where cable enters headphone slides - it is mostly for appearance and does not clamp onto the nylon cable.  There were no screws to non-destructively take the earpiece apart so, if they did not do a wire loop internally, tugging on the cable might detach it from solder connections - so treat with care.The problem is that like many manufacturers, this headphones' frequency response is biased towards bass.  It can serve well for low thumping sounds, but reproduction of mid-range is muddy and treble sorely lacking.  Not the best for classical music or voice conferencing.I have found the same problem in a set of Klipsch headphones, but not a cheaper Turtle Beach.  Point is that it is not always price, it is speaker design.  I have not tried conditioning the speakers by playing high frequency vocals in it continuously for 100+ hours.  Some claim that such ""burn in"" can help.  I will revise if it does.  But even if it does, it should not be necessary.  I wish manufacturers stopped trying to make ""punchy bass.""  That to me is not a positive attribute compared to flatter response when other headsets do not need an equalizer for better fidelity.There is a stated attempt to do sound limitation so too high sound is clamped.  Raising volume, I found that sound limiting functionality a little too subtle.  If setting it for a child or dependent adult, I would still test first.",the United States,False,0,R2FRNVF5LLMP94,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Sound quality is a _little_ tinny but they're cute!!!",4.0,TOPJOB7,2025-03-06,"Speaker size: 40mmFreq. Response: 20HzImpedence: 32 Ohm +-15%Cord Length: 4.92Ft/1.5MHeadphone Jack: 3.5mmSOUND QUALITY: the songs and voices come in clear from my phone, computers, etc. It also has great volume. But it's not perfect. These headphone specifications are identical with JBL's wired headphones (cost $12 more) so I hoped they would be as good. HOWEVER they unfortunately deliver a slightly tinny sound, because these are not made as well.BASS: The 20Hz shows that it could produce deep bass _but_ different drivers and ear cup size affect the hearing of bass. Since this is a little tinny I think the drivers and design are not as good for these headphones as more prestigious brand headphones (like JBL).DESIGN: I like how long the chord is, and that you can skip songs, answer calls, etc... with the button on the chord. However the cups don't hug flush to my head; the ears have a bit of a gap at the bottom. Good headphones (like JBL) are tight over my ears; this makes the sound quality better and it's less likely that other people hear your music.COMFORT: I love the soft ear padding and top band. These don't hurt my ears or my head and you can adjust the top to fit your head size! I find them comfy for hours of wearing.STYLE: these are the absolute cutest! The pink color is perfect and I got multiple compliments on it!!OVERALL: These are good headphones for the price of about $17-$20 or so, since better comparable headphones (like JBL) cost $30-$35. But I am sad that the headphones don't sit flush with my head and the sound quality is lower than I hoped, so I took off one star. However, I would recommend these to my friends since they're less expensive than bigger brands and they do work fine; they just aren't  amazingly great.",the United States,False,2,R2DHHCQSWTOHQY,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

One of the key features was the ability to limit the volume so he couldn't make them too loud. That's accomplished with a slider switch on the cord that limits to 85db. That works well but eventually he may figure out how to switch it, for now though its fine.Several other things I really like:1) they sound pretty good - these aren't audiophile headphones but they do isolate a bit and provide a full range of sound2) the ear pads are comfortable, that's a big deal to him, he was uncomfortable with his old ones and was always pulling at them, that eventually led to the cord breaking3) they are well made, nice braided cord (not just plastic) and an angled plug that will be hard to break off (see item 2).4) they look cool.Overall definately recommend.",the United States,False,1,R20NMLGBRISDDC,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

- Thought this was a bassy beats headphones to blow out my eardrums but its annoyingly quiet and has no bass.- It is however exceptionally clear and a great transparency/cancelling mode just not what i expected- the buttons are loud to press and initially i didnt think i would care but it does get annoying. 20 bucks jabra headsets have better buttons- no issue with calling/mic which i use them a lot for- they look at lesast 3x better than they sound- never buy these full price. I got them for $180 and still feel like i overpaid. If i could go back i would wait till the bose or sonys go on sale- disappointing cause after plugging into my mac and adjusting the eq i can see what the drivers really can do n its 1/2 what it sounds  like normally w bt-very comfy but after a year i do feel a difference, cups are starting to get harder now- disappointing cause i want my headphones to be louder than my airpods but these are not.

The transparency mode makes sound louder than it actually is to the natural ear. The ear cushions are soft. The connection process is easy. As an Apple user, I would have liked for them to switch through my Apple devices in an easier way like AirPods do but you have to manually connect to each device by going to the Bluetooth screen in the Apple drop down menu if you need to switch. I still love the headphones and would keep them. The quality of sound is awesome! 👏🏽 especially the compatibility with Dolby sound effects.

We're talking warped record distortion (for those of you who remember what warped vinyl sounded like). Yes, my drivers were up to date, etc. etc. After an hour of searching (no, AI did not help), I found the solution to fixing the sound distortion:Open SettingsClick on Bluetooth & devices (left side) then Devices on the rightScroll down and click on ""More devices and printer settings""Right-click on the ""Beats Studio Pro"" icon then click on PropertiesClick on Services tab and UNCHECK ""Handsfree Telephony""Click Apply, then OKThis probably means you can't use the headphones to talk/chat.

Unreliable and Not Worth the Price",1.0,W. Wheatley,2025-09-10,"I have bought 5 pairs of Apple Studio Beats Pros in the last few years, and every single pair eventually developed the same issue, a wooshing sound and failure in the right earcup. Apple replaced one pair under warranty, which makes it 6 pairs total. The exact same thing happened with my kids’ pairs as well, so I know it is not just me.For the cost of these headphones, it is unacceptable that they consistently fail shortly after the warranty period ends with normal daily use. These are marketed as premium headphones but the reliability does not match the price. I am done wasting money on replacements and will be trying another brand’s ANC and Bluetooth headphones that are not made by Apple.",the United States,False,0,R1D6G4VSUQR9PT,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Buy Bose QC instead",3.0,M. Smith,2025-09-08,"Sound good, lack Bass, however.Not great noise canceling. If its windy outside, it comes through the mics and right into your ears.The Beats app is one of the most generic Ive used. But, so are the headphones. 3 presets for music, which can ONLY be changed if theres a usb-c cable connected to the headphones????what a great idea. No equalizer options at all.I used these once to watch tv. The Bluetooth connected fine, but there was interference if another device is connected to the headphones as well. After that, they would never connect again to the tv, only to my phone. Yes I did all the reset options, re-pair, etc..  I bought a pair of Bose quietcomfort headphones during the same time I bought the Beats. The Bose QC connect flawlessly to my tv and all my other devices. The sound is incredible, with a much more comfortable fit. The Bose app has better options for customizing. Noise canceling on these, is so much better than the beats.  Zero wind noise with the Bose.The Beats studio pros never come out of the case anymore. No need. The Bose QC are superior in all aspects.",the United States,True,0,RY0TGM47QXR18,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

My third Beats Headsets: This should say it all!",5.0,Pumpkin Patch,2025-09-06,"I am a huge Beats fan. I purchased my first pair of Beats headsets early the Pandemic because my Apple buds were hurting my ears when I was on Zoom.

There's a great little video on YouTube with him in it but I couldn't hear him play in this quartet even with my old Beats. THIS NEW BEATS SET, THOUGH, HE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR--I ABSOLUTELY HEAR HIM SEPARATELY FROM THE OTHER THREE INSTRUMENTS.I purchased the Deep Brown headsets from Amazon instead of buying them from the Apple website, which is where I have always purchased Apple products when I buy online. Why did I buy on Amazon? There was a steep savings on the Deep Brown headsets!!!! It is one of the colors I was eyeing. But, the savings? It is over $100!!!! OMG! And yes, they are the real deal.Make sure you buy Apple Care. I have Apple Care on all my Apple products--it just makes life easier and Apple is so great about replacing items.

I WANTED TO LOVE YOU BUT COULDNT!! </3",3.0,Catherine on Amazon,2025-09-05,"I am very sad to return these back :(I purchased these honestly because I wanted people to leave me alone, ha. I live in a very populated area and sometimes, you just want to be outside and not have a handful of neighbors come up and chat you up. I also have dogs so sometimes yeah, I don't want to get stuck in the humdrum ""how old is your dog"" conversation.So I got these and for those 5-15 minute walks outside, they're not that bad. They fit just ok.I love the color of the sand.They're quite noise cancelling. Music quality is generally good but it's only noise cancelling to a certain degree. If you're in a busy loud area, I would say that it only drowns out 80%-ish of the noise.They also connected quite easily via bluetooth to my iphone.Overall, i thought it was easy to use.Love that they include a nice carrying case!However, my issue is....the WEIGHT AND COMFORT :(Anything over 15 minutes just drove me crazy. I recently wore them for 30+ minutes and I had to take them off because they push into the crown of my head.Now i will say that i dont think i particularly have a large head lol. If anything, I have a small head compared to those I've shared hats, etc. with.But the top of the headphones just drove itself into my head and it left it rather uncomfortable.Next is the mechanics of how you extend the legs to make them longer to fit your head, should you need them to be longer.It's so difficult!!!! If you have long hair, they inevitably will get trapped in the silver extension mechanism.I don't know why this part isn't covered a bit more to conceal the metal part, since I also think it's not pleasant to look at for a luxury good. It looks like you're looking under the hood of a nice device.I almost always pull out a piece of hair or two when I take them out - that's a lot of hair pulled out!I went back and forth and then back again deciding whether I should return these.Ultimately I decided to return them which is really sad :(I just don't see myself wearing these long term because they're so heavy and the fact that they push into my head.Really sad to be sending them back (if that hasn't already been made obvious from my review lol)I would definitely recommend them though to someone who asked for a headphone recommendation",the United States,True,0,R87YXDG4Y01UX,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Excelente",5.0,Kaliah Womack,2025-09-03,"Estos audífonos superaron mis expectativas. El sonido es nítido, con bajos potentes pero equilibrados, ideal tanto para música como para llamadas. La cancelación activa de ruido funciona de maravilla, realmente aísla del exterior y permite concentrarse al 100%.La batería es otro punto fuerte: dura horas y horas sin necesidad de cargarlos constantemente. Además, la conexión es muy rápida y estable, especialmente con dispositivos Apple, aunque también funcionan perfecto con Android.En cuanto a comodidad, son ligeros, se ajustan bien y no cansan después de usarlos mucho tiempo. El diseño es elegante y minimalista, muy resistente y de buena calidad.En resumen, si buscas audífonos con gran sonido, comodidad y una batería de larga duración, estos son una de las mejores opciones del mercado. ¡Recomendadísimos!",the United States,True,0,R3JZDR6CI6XDZQ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Quality Compact Case",5.0,Gavin Perry,2025-08-26,"Got this case for my beribes headphones, it’s worked great so far and I love how it’s designed. The case holds them tight so I don’t have to worry about the headphones shaking all about and between the cars outside case and the soft inside I don’t have to worry about them getting damaged. I got a black one and I think it fits the headphones well color wise. As seen in the picture the case includes a mesh pocket in the design which is super handy for keeping a charging cord, battery pack, or earbuds which allows you to use the case for more then just headphones which is nice. The case is easy to close and comes with a sturdy zipper on it. It also has a little loop attached to the outside that I like to use to hang it up on my wall.

Surprisingly good travel headphones for the price.",5.0,JLC,2025-01-20,"This is a Boomer review since younger people know much more about headphones than I do, and everyone has them.  But for those who only use headphones on the plane, especially for the noise canceling feature, this is for you.  I specifically looked for plug-in headphones because they are more comfortable than earbuds, and more reliable than bluetooth.  No, these are not Bose headphones, but hilariously, they rank second to Bose on many reviewers' lists!I bought these to replace my 15 year old Audio Technica headphones that still work but are falling apart.  I took both pairs with me on a recent trip and did a comparison.  I could not tell a difference between them, even though the Audio Technica ones covered my ears better.  When not watching movies I wore them just for the noise-cancelling feature, which worked just fine.  I am a relatively small woman so larger people might have a different experience with ear coverage.  These earphones fold up and become quite compact so they don't take up much room in your carry-on bag.  They fit neatly into small, semi-circular cases that are readily available on Amazon, and which  I highly recommend.  The nearly identical version of these headphones at about half the price does not have the noise canceling feature.

So lets be realistic about what you are getting. You are getting a pair of portable headphones that will REDUCE any surrounding noise to the point that whatever you are trying to listen to can be heard. They are not going to silence the surrounding noise, no open element headphone can. These are not the headphones I use when I am flying a plane, but they are the ones I use when I am flying commercially on a A320 and watching movies or listening to music. The battery life is very good, they fold up to reduce the amount of space they take up in your carry on, and they have a nice long cord .

Basically false advertising.",2.0,Amazon Customer,2025-01-04,"My sister got these for me for Christmas, knowing that i was looking for noise cancelling headphones so I wasn’t destroying my hearing. A big part of noise canceling headphones is that you don’t need to turn music up loud to hear since all outside noise is tuned out. Sony said on the box that it removes 95% of noise. That’s not true at all. I have to turn them up just as loud as my $10 wireless earbuds. The sound quality is okay but it removes maybe about 50% of ambient noise. Also, the sound quality is only good when turned up. These get quite dull and somewhat muddy at low volume which again makes them basically useless as advertised. They’re just cheap over ear headphones. That’s it. I’d be fine with them if they weren’t trying to claim 95% noise cancellation. Find something else. You also have to use a battery which is fun, I love listening to music only for the battery to die halfway through. They’re not rechargeable batteries either, it’s a physical battery. That’s just annoying in this day and age. I don’t want to spend a ton of money on batteries, we know they aren’t cheap anymore, and it makes so much additional waste.

The only drawback to these headphones is the  two wires coming from each side of the earpieces,  instead of one wire coming from only one side.

They may not last forever and don't have remarkable sound quality, but if you are need a pinch and need something functional and comfortable for everyday use, these will get the job done for music, YouTube, etc.  I had no issues using these on my flight and fortunately are foldable so that they are easy to travel with.

Worked great on plane but hurt after 2 hours",4.0,Amazon Customer,2024-04-11,Bought these for a trip and was excited to try them out on the plane.  They actually did a really good job with canceling out the noise of the plane!  They're wired so you an use them without batteries if your batteries every run out (but it won't sound so good).  Even found the perfect case to go with these on Amazon that was so cheap. The only thing I struggled with was that they started to hurt my ears (since they're not over the ear headphones) and the top of my head (no padding) after about 2 hours.  I've tried using them at Starbucks when working and same thing happens.  These are great for short-time use. I used them at the gym for 40-ish minutes and they were great!

Not Great",3.0,phillip mcknight,2025-09-18,"These are not great.  The range is abysmal, but not a problem if you only ever use them with a phone that's in your pocket. There are weird syncing issues where one earbud will lose connection randomly and you have to put both back in the case to get them to re-sync. The case also doesn't have any indication of when the battery is low.  There is a light bar on the front that i thought was a battery gage but isn't.  Not really sure what it's purpose is. The space A40 is a better earbud but less comfortable, more expensive, and has more awkward controls.  I picked these up for like $20 on sale, and they're worth it for that price but I wouldn't pay full price.",the United States,True,0,R19QMKSW5E1NK3,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Not worth the time or money.",1.0,Hope you have a tap set.,2025-09-17,"I purchased these because my Soundcore Lifenote earbud case was malfunctioning and auto connecting while in the case. I was disappointed with these right out of the box. When first used on a windy day I could barely hear music at full volume. The ear buds do not seat well in my ears even with the smallest size. I can't here anything over my lawnmower which is what I primarily use them for. After barely using them for a few months now the right ear buds gives 10% battery alert after 5 minutes of use and these now auto connect while charging in the case. My old Soundcore lasted me over 3 years using them almost everyday. These have been used a few dozen times and already have failing batteries and connection problems, plus the poor fitting problem. I will not be buying anything Soundcore after this aggravating experience. Quality has gone to garbage and I don't care to waste more money seeing others have similar issues with this brand now.

Good if it would stay in your ear",3.0,Chris M,2025-09-17,I've tried a few budget earbuds. These definitely have some nice features but they just don't stay in my ear regardless of what ear tip I use. The sound is just average. The lows are fine but the highs can get a bit staticky and distortioned unless you turn it way down in which case you no longer hear the highs. The case that can double as a phone stand is great. The features like noise canceling and transparency mode are also good. You can connect to two different devices at the same time which is cool.

Soundcore P30i Review – $30 Earbuds That Rival $300?",4.0,J P,2025-09-17,"My Honest Review of the Soundcore P30iI’ve previously owned the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds, which I loved, but unfortunately I lost one at work and couldn’t find it. I picked up the Soundcore P30i as a replacement, and here’s my honest breakdown across different areas:Sound Quality (5/5)The P30i delivers rich, clear audio that works well across almost every genre. Straight out of the box, the sound quality impressed me—I didn’t need to tweak anything. For those who like customization, the Soundcore app offers a built-in equalizer, but honestly, the factory settings are already excellent.Comfort & Fit (4/5)These come with multiple ear tip sizes so you can find a snug fit. For casual listening, they’re comfortable and secure, but I wouldn’t recommend them for workouts or running—I feel like they might slip out with too much movement. Still, with the right ear tip size, they should stay put for most everyday use.Features & Controls (3/5)Out of the box, the touch controls are limited—you can’t adjust volume unless you configure it through the Soundcore app. Once set up, it works fine, but I was surprised volume wasn’t included by default. This could be frustrating for users who expect full control straight away.Battery Life & Charging (6/5 🤯)The battery life is insane. Up to 24 hours of continuous use on a full charge, and if you’re not using them, they can last up to a month. Honestly, it feels like these could double as a power bank—Energizer vibes for sure. Definitely one of the strongest features of the P30i.Build Quality & Value (5/5)At just $30, the value here is unbeatable. I’ve owned $300 earbuds that sound amazing, but for a tenth of the price, the P30i delivers surprisingly close performance. And let’s be real—if you tend to lose earbuds every few months like me, replacing a $30 pair hurts a lot less than a $300 pair. For what you get, this is hands down one of the smartest buys out there.⸻✅ Final Verdict: The Soundcore P30i punches way above its price tag. Incredible battery life, solid sound, and unbeatable value. While they’re not ideal for workouts and the controls could be better, at $30 these are an easy recommendation.",the United States,True,0,R2T3KS3PLQD1XS,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Very good set of headphones.",5.0,Allan D Cheney,2025-09-17,"Originally I had the p3i. It looks like they do not make it anymore so I had to get the p30i. Positive side of this is they are a little more compact and comfortable in the ear. I have not yet had a chance to measure out exactly how long the battery last in this one. But if it's anything like the p3i it should be exceptional.The cons to this one are that it has very limited setup when it comes to button usage for your phone. The p30i does not allow you to double tap to hang up the phone where the p3i did. All in all, I would say that this is a very good set of headphones though.

They are always ON",1.0,Wendy,2025-09-14,"I'm writing a review, which I never do, because I am unsatisfied with this product. I bought this LESS THAN 6 months ago and there is already a defect/issue. The ear buds never turn off when they are in the case, and continue to sync up with all my devices, using up all the battery. They also randomly bluetooth sync to my devices even when I don't have them on or did not ask it to switch over (example: if my ear buds are in its case in my purse, but I pick up a phone call from my phone, it'll go to the ear buds even though I am not wearing them). What is the point of a long battery life if it never turns off and uses up all the battery throughout the day, and can't tell when it's in use or when it is not?

Great while it lasted",2.0,Beeloves2read,2025-09-13,"I got these because I wanted to try earbuds I could use with dual connectivity between my laptop and cellphone.  These were well rated and relatively inexpensive compared to the alternatives.  Getting them connected wasn't difficult once you figure out how to use the app and turn on the dual connectivity option.  The sound quality for calls was fine.  The automatic switching between devices worked really well with only a few instances where I'd have to manually connect to a device.  The only irritating part of switching is when I was on a conference call on the laptop and my phone would ring.  Not a big deal though.  The issue with these started about 3-4 months in (I've had them for 5).  The right earbud just stopped working and no longer is operational at all.  Doesn't charge, doesn't do anything.  The left one still works but now it's starting to lose it's charge more quickly than it did a couple of months ago.  I'm also only using it with my cellphone now because I got a new laptop and didn't set it up.  I'm not sure I can set it up with only one earbud anyways because I think I had to have both to connect to Bluetooth.  I'll eventually find another pair of earbuds, probably not another pair of this one though.  Maybe my experience isn't typical but I wanted to share in case it helps someone else make a decision.

I’ve worn them for hours while working and never felt pressure on my head or ears. The battery life is crazy good; I can go days without charging, and the quick charge is a lifesaver.I’ve used other brands before, but for the price, these feel like a steal. If you want reliable noise cancelling and amazing sound without spending $400+, these are the ones to get.",the United States,True,0,R15IKGYLR1XEIL,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Phenomenal Sound & Noise Cancellation",5.0,Ralph Laurence,2025-09-08,"These JBL 770 wireless headphones are phenomenal, especially for the price point — you really can’t beat them. The active noise cancellation is top-notch. With music playing, you’re completely isolated from the outside world. I’ve had moments in an Uber where the driver was speaking to me, and I didn’t even realize it until they got my attention — that’s how well the ANC works.Compared to the JBL 650 Live, the 770s are a major improvement. The earmuff design is far more comfortable and breathable, and the battery life is outstanding. With the 650s, I was always recharging, but the 770s last so much longer — one full charge can carry you through all-day use without worry.Sound quality is where these shine. The bass hits hard, like a properly tuned car audio system with a solid amp. At the same time, mids and highs are clear and balanced, giving you a full, powerful listening experience. You don’t need to spend more on premium brands — these headphones deliver everything: comfort, long battery life, great ANC, and phenomenal sound.Bottom line: The JBL 770s are an incredible upgrade over the 650s and a 5/5 value.I’m",the United States,True,2,R2SKG4ATQYFLVO,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I use these for work a lot but with the design it's a little hard to tell what you're pushing sometimes. The volume control doesn't stand out like it should or should maybe be on the other side. I would say they are definitely adorable though, they have fell off my head once or twice with me not realizing they are still on but have been completely fine, so I would say durability is not an issue.

Works good - prefer slightly larger ear cups",4.0,Jon Fox,2025-08-16,"I will admit I am not a sound snob but do know what I like.  These have been great for me and my purposes.  I use them mostly for doing meetings via Team on my laptop.  They connect easily, mic works and I hear everyone talking great.  I listen to various music on occasion and I like the way they sound and that you can do your own sound mix via the phone app.  The only complaint I have is the design of the ear cups are just a tad small in my estimation and tend to hurt my ears after a while (hours not minutes) as I use them for lots of meetings during my normal day.  I like the ambient option because I need to be able to hear what is going on around me also as I help care for my elderly mother and cannot totally disconnect from the world (even though I may like to :) ).  I have had for 2-3 months now and quality seems good to me and had no problems.  I can use for 4-5 days of meetings (not sure exact hours) without needing to charge which I like.

Good Headphones, albeit some problems.",3.0,Michael,2025-08-14,"So the stars can be a bit decieving but here is my honest review of the headphones.Pros:1. Functionality: The JBL Lives are awesome, form fit and function are all present. The touch panel settings are annoying but they can be disabled in the app. The fabric band fits great around the head, the ear cups are a bit small but the pads are comfortable enough that they don't really bother me even with extended normal/gym use.2. Battery life is absolutely stellar, I only recharged these once every two weeks at best. Definitely amongst the best I have ever used from multiple brands.3. ANC is just good, a bit underwhelming around loud conversations but still decent enough.Cons:1. I'm not sure if I had an isolated case, but my JBL Live 770NCs had a weird issue where the audio skipped or random loud buzzing would appear at random intervals. I tried resetting the unit but no solutions were present. Unfortunately JBL did not a replacement policy so I never found out if this was an issue with my own unit.2. ANC does not work for phone calls. This was very weird as most of my older headphones from other brands would use ANC for phone calls too. Not sure why JBL disables it hereFinal: While these headphones were awesome in many ways, that abrupt audio static/buzzing was too annoying to deal with, especially when sometimes it happened multiple times per song. The ANC cutting off during phone calls especially were an issue when speaking in crowds. I ultimately returned the unit but if these are issues you can live with, they're still a fantastic choice, just not for me personally.",the United States,True,0,R1T7LZ5FH4EI1H,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great headphones for the money",5.0,Havok,2025-08-06,"I shopped around a lot of different over the ear headphones before landing on these. Looking at fit, comfort, battery life and ANC as points to hit. These fit every point for me. I use them mostly at work for Teams calls and music streaming. They pair to my laptop and my phone at the same time and they work wonderfully between both devices. They fit well without to much pressure while feeling secure. Fit was important as I am prone to headaches with tighter fitting headphones. The ear cups are a tad snug for my ears but once you get them in the right place, they work great. ANC is a perfect level to block noise from others working around me. Also switching to the walkthrough option is nice. I do wish that switch could be done on the headset instead of the mobile app though. Battery life gets me through about 3 full days of work as an IT analyst that gets frequent calls. Since these were on sale, the value was very high and they were a much better option than other high end brands. The sound quality from these, for me is perfect. But I'm not an audio snob.

Damn.",4.0,ron,2025-08-01,"we're done here.  No need for anyone else to make any other headphones, these are all we need, thank you.With the current ""return to work"" policy, i find myself wearing headphones most of the day.  For me, ear buds fall out, the on-ear headphones i was given for teams mtgs hurt after a couple hours and they sound like, well, cheap headphones.  So i looked for some good comfortable over-the-ear phones that i can listen to music for hours.I've never been disappointed by anything JBL that i've bought in the past, so i gave these a shot, and damn.  I mean Damn!I've had them on all day, they're light and comfortable, they don't move from where you put them.  The SOUND is unreal.  There is nothing in the way of performance i could ask.  These do it all.  I can dial in exactly what i want with the eq, and there's alwaaays more power until even i say ""ok, its loud enough!""Another reviewer mentioned the equalizer could ""test your hearing and adapt the equ to it.""  my hearing is courtesy of Marshall Amplification, so this was one of the decision points for me.  i was looking forward to having the app sort it all out, but i can't find it.The adaptive ambient thing, i dont know.  spent some time pushing buttons and it sort of changes things, but i can't make it do what the blurb says it does.  The ""quick start""?  nearly useless, maybe those who already know how to use the headphones can understand what its trying to say.  Maybe i didn't pay enough attention in ""cave drawing interpretation"" class to understand the pictographs, so i gotta take away a star because, while its simple to do simple things, its so frustrating to make them do all the flashy things the sales blurb says they can do.  Nevertheless.  As straight up headphones, Damn!  These own it.  everybody else, just go home.BUT, IT SURE WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A REAL USER GUIDE SO ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO JUST POKE AROUND IN THE DARK!It also would be nice to have a version of the app that works on Windoze.They pair easily between my android phone and my laptop.  The quickstart had a pictograph of the blutooth symbol pointing to a button on the headphones so that was clear enough.  still can't get the adaptive ambient thing going though.",the United States,True,2,R2WTAM3ITSD81L,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great Sound and Comfort, But Some Design Quirks",3.0,Simon,2025-07-17,"The sound quality is excellent—rich, clear, and immersive. The headphones are lightweight and super comfortable, with a fabric headband that feels great during long sessions.But the design has a few misses:1) The on/off slide switch is awkwardly placed right next to the volume buttons, and I often end up turning the headphones off by accident when trying to adjust the volume. -- I deduct one star for this in my review.2) Also, the touch-sensitive area for activating the assistant is way too sensitive—it mutes the audio briefly even if I just brush it with my arm.  -- I deduct one star for this in my review.On the plus side, the Android app is fantastic for customizing EQ curves, and once set, those EQ settings apply across all devices without needing to install the app on each one. That’s a huge win.Wishlist:JBL really ought to standardize the button layout across their Bluetooth headphone models—especially between the Live and Tune series. A consistent control scheme would make switching between models seamless and intuitive, instead of feeling like you have to relearn muscle memory every time you upgrade or swap.Right now, it’s like jumping from one vehicle to another, only to find the brake and gas pedals have been creatively relocated. It’s not just inconvenient—it’s disruptive to the flow.

Poor build quality; cannot use audio and mic at the same time",1.0,Lovinity,2025-06-23,"I really want to like these headphones for all of the functionality offered in the app and the comfort of wearing them. And the audio quality is decent (a little bass-forward, not anything too impressive but does the job). But I cannot.At a price of nearly $100, you expect a good build quality. Unfortunately, the hinges are enforced with cheap plastic, and with mild use, my left ear cup broke off after only a couple months. Luckily, it's holding together with tape. But for $100, this is unacceptable.Additionally, I wanted the ability to use both audio and mic input at the same time on Bluetooth (e.g. Google Voice calls). But that doesn't work; I can only use one or the other. That defeats the purpose of portability. I don't think I ever used them on an actual call, so they probably work fine on those. But for Google Voice users, these will not do.Therefore, I would not recommend these headphones at this price point.

Very Comfortable, not the best sounding",3.0,Chrustin,2025-06-23,"I recently tried out the JBL Live 770NC headphones, and while they didn’t quite win me over, they definitely had some strong points. The audio quality, honestly, was a bit of a letdown for me. I’m a big fan of deep, punchy bass—love my Skullcandy ANC Crusher 2s for that—and the JBLs just didn’t deliver the same level of richness or clarity. The sound felt a little flat, especially when I cranked up bass-heavy tracks. Compared to the Skullcandys, the 770NCs couldn’t keep up in terms of depth or overall vibrancy, which was a dealbreaker for me.That said, I can’t say enough about how comfortable these headphones are. The fit was fantastic—super lightweight, with soft ear cushions that didn’t pinch or get sweaty even after a couple of hours. I could’ve worn them all day without issue, and that’s not something I say about every pair of headphones. They also come with a nice case for travel, which is a plus.

Really pleased with sound quality, materials quality, and overall fitment. Speaking of fitment, this set is between on-ear and over-ear but closer to being fully over-ear. The folding ear pieces make for easy storage but I did need to buy a third-party rigid headphone case just to prevent premature wear and tear. I really enjoy the EQ flexibility using the JBL app, which I didn’t realize I’d enjoy as much as I do. I’ve got a number of custom EQ presets and as a former sound engineer, that really checks a box for me. I’ve been very impressed with the battery life over both domestic and international flights.

They are okay",4.0,kshav6,2025-06-11,The sound is fine on them.  I don't like that you barely put your hand over the ride side ear piece and it mutes it or calls up Siri.  I never realized how many times I put my arm over my head and over my right ear.  I haven't figured out the side buttons too well yet either.  Not very intuitive.  The headphones fit great on my head and aren't too tight. I found out when they are connected to my computer and my phone the switch back and forth isn't seamless.  I was using the headphones for the computer when I got a phone call.  I went into the other room to take the call and all of a sudden (well into the call) I couldn't hear the person any more.

Great headphones/noise cancellation for the price!",4.0,Alexa Dowalter,2025-08-15,"I love these headphones. I purchased these for the purpose of autism accommodation (noise cancellation). They are amazing quality for the price! After watching many comparison videos for noise cancelling headphones, these were the best for the price and ranked very closely to the Sony xm5 & xm6. (Half the price) The sound quality is amazing, and the noise cancellation is top tier for the price. The transparency is really nice quality. The app is easy to use and has an option for widget for easy access on Home Screen. You can personalize your sound through a quiz, adjust the noise cancellation 1-5, as well as adjust transparency 1-5.The only problem I have dealt with is size. I have them on the smallest setting, which feels a little loose (I have a bigger head so I was surprised). When I’m sitting straight up or laying back the noise cancellation is great, I have noticed when I look down or move my head side to side I can hear more outside noise because of the not so tight fit. They are comfortable. I do not think you could run, workout, or work with these on unless you have a huge head😅This is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones, so I would say to anyone not having experience: there is pressure with the noise cancellation. I only noticed this at first but no longer noticing after using for a few days. It isn’t overwhelming by any means, just noticeable at first when trying for the first time.Other things I love about them: I do love the tactile buttons, color, and comfort! I also love the ability to use the noise cancellation without using Bluetooth!Overall, I would buy these again.

Great product until they break (<1y)",3.0,HariboBerriesBaby,2025-08-07,"I really want to give this product a better review. The audio quality punches way above its price point, the noise cancelling works pretty well, the battery life is frankly terrific, and the ear cups are comfortable enough for long and regular use! They're pretty great for as long as they remain unbroken. That said, the plastic used for this product is extremely weak. I've owned two pairs of the Soundcore Space Q45s, hoping that it was a fluke, and it unfortunately wasn't. There's a failure point in the plastic of the headband, right above the ear cups on both sides, where most of the stress of the elasticity needed to hold it on your head is focused. In the case of both sets of Q45s I've owned, the plastic in that point has broken (even seeming to begin crumbling) less than a year into their use. It's really a bummer. By every other metric I love these headphones, but the materials used are too cheap.

They vibrate like crazy making enjoying music impossible. Support won't do anything for me. And they won't even give me a discount on a new pair. If you spend 150$ on some headphones they should absolutely last longer than 2 years. No longer gonna buy any of these headphones.

Great Sound, Comfort, and Noise Cancellation",5.0,Andrés David Martínez Sánchez,2025-07-28,"Great Sound, Comfort, and Noise CancellationI've been using the Anker Space Q45 headphones for a while now, and I have to say they're some of the best I've tried in this price range. First off, they're extremely comfortable – the ear cushions are soft and don’t press against my ears, even during long listening sessions.The sound quality is excellent. Anker offers a dedicated app that lets you customize the EQ to your liking, which is a great bonus. Battery life is one of the standout features – I’ve been using them for about 5 hours a day, and they lasted me nearly two weeks on a single charge. That’s seriously impressive.Noise cancellation is also very good for the price. I’ve tried other headphones that cost more and don’t block out sound as well as these. They’re especially effective at reducing constant background noises like chatter, street noise, TV sounds, or engine hums. Sudden, sharp noises like car horns or hammering can still be heard a bit, but that’s expected.Another nice bonus: they come with a 3.5mm jack and support Hi-Fi over Bluetooth. With LDAC enabled, the audio becomes even clearer and more detailed, which is amazing at this price point.Overall, these are a great buy – super comfortable, great sound, long battery life, and impressive noise cancellation.

Great Sound but No Included Windows App",4.0,Curtis Brooks,2025-07-20,"These are great headphones that produce much clearer sound than my old headphones. The price during Amazon Prime Days was excellent as well. Setup was a breeze for both wired and bluetooth connectivity, although the included cord is just a bit short. My only reason for knocking off one star is because there is not a native Windows pc app for controlling the sound via an equalizer - even my previous (cheap) headphones have that.  I was able to download an equalizer app  for the pc, but one would think Anker would be able to easily produce a Windows-compatible app.",the United States,True,0,R2JEJAHRRJSBQ5,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Could be better. Muddy out the box",3.0,Titannews,2025-07-16,"I bought these for an upgrade from my Q20. The  sound is good for a $150 but definitely wait for a sale. I even played around with the app and everything, adjusted the equalizer accordingly to some reviews these just sound like they are just missing something. In my opinion for the money the Q20 or Q30 blow these out of the water for the price for the sound out the box, except for the noise cancellation the Q20 and Q30 are very weak. I will say Q45 have exceptional good noise cancellation that is up there with the $300 ones, and the transparency mode is ok its hard to beat AirPod pro’s transparency. I was really hoping for these and a bit excited after reading some of the reviews on here. Apparently there is a burn in period for these to really sound good. Right now there are just ok. The sound quality is muddy out the box, and you have to play around with the setting to get the sound you want. The soundcore signature present doesn’t sound good at all which is sad, and the when you bass boost it, the highs are cringy. All the other preset are good for what they are. Highly recommend exploring for yourself or copy other people’s EQ. All in all they are great for the money especially when you get them on sale like I did $85. They are not the most empress sound but the ANC is amazing.Update: I returned them. I was just not happy with the sound options. You can have really clear vocals and sound with no depth of bass or really good depth with bass and terrible vocals. Tired watching a movie and thats when I finally gave up with sound tuning and just returned them. If you don’t like bass and just want clear vocals (after tuning with the app) then these may be for you. To be far you can get a little bit of bass out of them after mess with the app, but will say the presets are terrible for bass. I will add these headphones don’t sound great out of the box and you have to download the app and set your experience.Like I said early I really wanted to like these, the ANC is amazing! They are comfortable and light weight, it’s  just the sound isn’t there for me.",the United States,True,4,R37B1BAV8QKEVL,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Headphones are too tight",3.0,Javon,2025-07-08,"The headphones were too tight on my head even when extended, causing my ears to hurt and gave me a headache within 30 minutes of wearing them making them unusable so I had to return them. Besides the pain I got from wearing the headphones, the sound quality was better than I expected. The noise cancelling wasn't as good as I thought it would be as I could still hear people talking but the anc did block low frequency sounds such as fans. The charging speed was very fast 5 minutes of charging = 4 hours of battery. When I got the headphones they were at medium battery but I charged them for around 20 minutes and it was already at 90%. The right earphone was also making a metal clanking noise when it moved I don't know if that is by design or an issue with my pair, it is much more noticeable when you have the headphones on. The headphones also felt kind of heavy. All of the touch features were working with bluetooth mode on. The anc control (transparent, normal, and anc) the power off, power on, and bluetooth pairing. The volume control was working fine and the play/pause worked fine. All touch features except noise cancelling control only worked in bluetooth mode not wired. Do I feel like I got my money's worth? Not really the anc is good for blocking out low frequency sounds the passive noise cancelling is alright as I could hear a sound that sounded like wind the wind sound is more noticeable when anc is turned on and the higher you increase the anc blocking level the more you hear that sound. The headphones were uncomfortable on my head but the sound quality was good and it is even better when you use the soundcore app. I tried changing my sound mode to ldac mode on the android app and it did sound better the only downside to that is ldac only works with android phones and you can only be connected to one device at a time through bluetooth when ldac mode is turned on.",the United States,True,2,R1FDC6NW73TLWH,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Quality to value is not there.",2.0,Phillip Green,2025-06-06,"Come on Logitech. The $100 price point demands some higher quality function. These are not high quality. They are not what we have come to expect from the Logitech brand. The sound is weak and lacking depth. So much, I may be returning them just for that reason. I should not have to turn them up this far to hear. I don't have to do that on any other set. There is a static played when active. That is totally annoying. Sometimes there is a static or electronic sound when others speak. Again, that is a quality issue. They did pair easily and the battery seems to be holding after the first day. So far the mic is adequate and the noise cancelling does reduce the ambient noise. The Bluetooth seems to be stable and stays connected even if when the laptop goes to sleep.

Mic wasn't as good as I was hoping",4.0,Wil,2025-04-17,"I tested the mic for this product, and it is just as low, and actually less clear too I think, than the Sony XM4... (at least in a quiet room, not sure if there's background noise in an office because I didn't test that).I guess that people will have to turn up the volume to 50% when I use the Sony XM4 for voice notes on WhatsApp... as the Logitech and Sony XM4 were both a little low, when listening on 25% volume on my iPhone.4 stars because besides that it is a well designed product for $100, and I love that the microphone folds up and mutes when folded up.

It's a quick fix, turning them off and back on, but it's a total nuisance since I use these for work and the only way to tell if everything is 'off' is to hear a voice that sounds broken up and almost robotic.They have fantastic range, and I love that lifting the mic boom up will automatically mute the mic on the device, as well as in Teams - when I am on a call and need to not be heard this is extremely handy.

Does the job really well",4.0,Nisa,2025-04-14,"My goal here is to use it for work, and being in CS, I needed the microphone quality to be clear so customers could hear me really well. These headphones are quite comfortable and don't strain my head (I have a medium-sized head that is pretty sensitive, so if it was too much, I would've felt it). The audio quality is good, too; I don't really use the button features yet (it's been a week), but I have already enjoyed so far placing my mic up and down to mute myself when needed.My only concern so far, but not major, is that I do hear delays sometimes in notifications, potentially due to this being on Bluetooth. However, this only happens so far in 1 app and not others, so it could be a browser/app issue. Additionally, I work for 8.5 hours straight with breaks, but somehow, sometimes the headphones will turn off after a while, give or take, every 40-50 minutes (? - I could be missing something from the manual). Connectivity beyond the above mentioned concern, is good.Overall, it's good; I'd recommend it and am happy with this quality for its price.",the United States,True,0,RXDRE730NZWVU,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The noise-canceling mic keeps background chatter from bleeding in, so the person on the other end hears me clearly even if I’m in a busy coffee shop. The ear cushions are soft enough for long sessions without making my ears sore.Switching between devices is smooth, and the USB dongle makes it easy to connect to my laptop without digging through Bluetooth menus. The mic mute is a quick flip, which is great for when I need to cough or have a side conversation without everyone hearing it.It feels sturdy but light, so it’s easy to forget I’m wearing it until I take it off. I’ve gone through plenty of headsets, but this one hits the sweet spot between sound quality, comfort, and convenience.",the United States,False,1,R3EIANQ2Q85RBC,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I like that it works well across both Mac and Windows without lagging out or disconnecting out of the blue.I found the sound pretty good, because people can hear me clearly during calls, and I can hear them as well.

Long Workdays with Clear Mic Quality",5.0,levy,2025-07-30,"The performance was above my expectations. I mainly use it for Zoom meetings, phone calls, and virtual team meetings on my laptop. The wireless range is also excellent. I can walk around my home office and kitchen to make coffee without the sound changing. The signal strength is consistent, which helps reduce aggravation and makes it easier to keep conversations going without interruptions. The headset's well-spread and straightforward controls make it easy for me to find and use them. It seems natural and responsive to answer a call, change the volume, or turn off the microphone. Even if it's a small thing, it matters when you have many things to do during the day.

Better than I expected",5.0,JOJO,2025-07-28,"I think the standout feature of it is the noise-canceling microphone, which can effectively block out background noise and ensure clear voice transmission. This is particularly important to me as it significantly improves my communication efficiency at work. The mute function is intuitive to operate and can quickly mute when needed. I like the USB adapter it comes with - connecting it to my computer is both fast and simple. The battery is also one of its strong points - it can easily support a full week of usage. The comfort level is usually good and it is suitable for long-term use, although after using it continuously for several hours, you might feel a slight pressure in your ears.

Bluetooth Headset with Microphone",5.0,TU HY THAI HAU,2025-07-25,"A pleasing equilibrium was achieved in terms of sound quality for both speech and media playback as well. When I switched to listening to background playlists in between conversations, the 40 mm speakers provided me with clean midranges and warm bass, which helped me concentrate better without drowning out any alerts that were coming in. The music that was streamed via Bluetooth had a more dynamic feel to it than is often experienced with regular workplace headsets, which demonstrates that this model can also be used as a pleasant listening device for leisure listening after work is over. I have also been amazed by its durability. Even after constantly rotating in my swivel chair and sometimes bumping the headset against the edge of my desk, I did not see any looseness in the joints or misalignment in the headband. The matte coating was resistant to smudges and small scuffs, allowing it to keep its professional image even after weeks of usage at a busy workplace. Because of its small form, I was able to hang the headset on a simple hook next to my monitor. Additionally, the construction of the headset stayed stable regardless of whether I was using it or putting it away.",the United States,False,1,R2MUSMU0LGW3YC,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The bass has enough punch without sounding muddy, and the highs come through clearly. Even on my noisy subway rides, I can still hear everything without a problem. What surprised me was how well the microphone's noise cancellation works. My coworkers told me my voice sounds clearer now than when I used the phone speaker. They’re also so light that I can wear them for hours without my ears feeling sore.

Sure the Bose is built better as you would expect for something so pricy, but this one is a $20 headphone, I was expecting hard plastic throughout, but it had cushioning in key spots just like the Bose. The left and right ear caps swivels in many directions. The headband can be pulled, shortened and adjusted for head width. Overall its incredibly comfy on my medium sized head.I plug the USB-C into my phone and it works immediately.I am not an audiophile, so I wouldn’t be able to tell you sound nuance or vocabulary like bass, timbre. This is obviously not an Bose and the biggest difference I can tell is the lack of noise cancellation feature. Everything sounds a bit echoing. And if someone was super close to me, it also leaks a bit of sound. But you’d have to be super close within 1 feet. I would pick up the Bose if I needed deep concentration to focus on work. But for watching news, movies, normal stuff, this really isn’t bad for $20.I would totally purchase this again.

Not Bad For The Price",4.0,Grandpa Gadget,2025-01-24,"The USB-C Headphones Wired Over-Ear offer an decent blend of sound quality, comfort, and versatility, making them a worthy contender for anyone seeking headphones compatible with a wide range of devices equipped with USB Type-C ports. I recently had the chance to try these headphones, and here’s my honest take.Sound Quality:The standout feature of these headphones is the HD stereo sound. The audio isn't great, but it's not bad either,  delivering a decent listening experience for music, podcasts, videos, and even virtual meetings. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming, while the mids and highs retain clarity, making it suitable for various genres of music. Whether you're an audiophile or just someone who loves immersive sound, these headphones deliver a decent performance for their price point.Build and Comfort:The over-ear design is cushioned with soft, plush ear pads that fit comfortably without causing fatigue during extended wear. The foldable design adds a layer of portability, making these headphones ideal for travelers, commuters, or anyone constantly on the go. They are lightweight yet sturdy, and the adjustable headband ensures a snug but comfortable fit for both adults and teens.Microphone and Volume Control:The addition of a built-in microphone and inline volume control makes these headphones versatile for various uses, from conference calls to gaming and casual chatting. The microphone picks up voice clearly and is suitable for Zoom calls or online classes, although it may not be ideal for professional-grade recording. The volume control is conveniently placed and responsive, eliminating the need to fiddle with device settings.USB-C Compatibility:In the age of shrinking headphone jacks, these USB Type-C headphones are a lifesaver for users of Chromebooks, laptops, tablets, and smartphones that lack a traditional 3.5mm audio port. They connect seamlessly to modern devices, making them especially convenient for people who rely on USB-C connections, like Samsung Galaxy devices or recent MacBooks. It's worth verifying compatibility with your specific device before purchase, but in my testing, the headphones worked well across multiple platforms.Portability and Durability:The foldable feature is an excellent addition, allowing the headphones to collapse and fit effortlessly into backpacks or travel cases. While the build feels robust enough for everyday use, heavy handling might show wear and tear over time. Treating them with care should help extend their lifespan.Potential Drawbacks:- Device Compatibility Limitations: While they are great for USB-C devices, users with older hardware featuring only 3.5mm jacks will need an adapter or alternative headphones.- Passive Noise Isolation Only: These headphones rely on the fit of the ear cushions for noise isolation, which is adequate but not ideal in very noisy environments. They do not feature active noise cancellation (ANC), which might be a dealbreaker for frequent flyers or those in loud offices.- Wire Dependence: For users accustomed to wireless freedom, the wired nature of these headphones might feel restrictive, though it ensures a more stable connection with no concerns about battery life.Final Verdict:The USB-C Headphones Wired Over-Ear are a good choice for those looking for headphones that balance performance, comfort, and price. Their compatibility with USB-C devices is a huge selling point, especially in a market where wireless options dominate but aren't always reliable. The combination of HD stereo sound, microphone functionality, and portability makes them a versatile option for daily use, whether at home, the office, or on the go.If you’re someone who doesn’t mind the wired connection and is looking for a reliable pair of headphones without breaking the bank, this is a solid choice. However, if you need advanced features like ANC or wireless functionality, you might want to explore other options. For their price range and feature set, these headphones provide excellent value, especially for students, remote workers, or casual travelers.",the United States,False,4,R1MVPJ646T74AF,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Clear Sound, Very Comfortable, Not Noise Cancelling",5.0,LindaDP,2025-01-17,"Originally, I purchased a USB-C adapter for my old headphones which had a 3.5mm connection, it kept making the sound skip and I had to keep adjusting the connection because the sound kept going out. Finally, I ordered these headphones already wired with a USB-C Connection for my Smartphone. What a difference! The sound is so clear and these headphones are very soft and comfortable on my ears. I like that the the thick braided wire only comes out of one Earcup. My old ones had a thin wire out of each Earcup and they always got tangled. I never thought I would use the audio control panel on the wire but I have already used it several times. I can adjust the volume and pause the sound when I stop to talk to someone. It saves having to keep taking my phone out of the pouch I keep it in.They fold easily for travel. The thick headband takes a bit of time to get used to if you are transitioning from a thinner one.These headphones are not noise canceling but for my purpose, I did not want that feature. I use them to walk and listen to audiobooks so I am happy to hear the traffic or if someone comes up behind and is trying to pass.I would not recommend these for a child because the headband just fits me, with no adjustment, and I am an adult with a small head. The soft cushiony earmuffs keep my ears toasty warm while walking in the winter and I hope it will not be too hot when walking in the summer.",the United States,False,2,R16KZBY709ZQNX,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

More like ""on"" ear rather than ""over"" ear",4.0,Jessica,2025-01-12,"I really wanted over-the-ear headphones, they are just personally more comfortable for me, and these sit on my ears. My ears aren't especially large, but I know there are people with smaller ears and this would probably be over-the-ear for them. They are comfortable but could be more comfortable if the pads had a little more ""cush"" to them. The sound quality is really great and the in-line controls are very convenient.

Cute But Uncomfortable",3.0,Mommabear3131,2025-01-10,"Received this product very quickly and undamaged.I have been looking for an alternative to earbuds as those tend to hurt my ears. Headphones have always been very comfortable; I came across these and thought I would give them a try.The color is very nice, especially for girls. Product appears to be good quality, and I like the fact that this plug right into your phone. For me, since that is where I listen to almost everything (music, YouTube, movies, etc.) this works for me. Plus, I can use these on phone calls when at home for more hands-free conversations and not having to use the speakerphone function.It also came with instructions that were very clear to understand and just the right amount of detail to get to know how the headphones function.The only cons really that I have for these are:1. the headphones themselves are on the smaller size and became uncomfortable after a while and became uncomfortable to wear. So, if I wanted to watch a movie, I most likely will not use these as it will be very uncomfortable after a while.2. I wear glasses, and these were a tad difficult to wear with my glasses. I have not had this issue with past headphones so, not sure why this was an issue but will keep working with them to find a remedy.3. The sound quality was decent but not the greatest. When I am listening to upbeat music, I like bass and good sound quality and this is not quite delivered with these headphones; however, it is not the worst sound quality either, it is pretty decent.Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.

This is disappointing but I work around by using my Bose speaker, which can be used while charging BTW, and charge the headphones. That being said, these are great headphones! I love the sage green color, so unique. They are very comfortable. The buttons are easy to use. I had no trouble pairing them on multiple devices. They are very sturdy and the way they fold is so convenient. The sound quality is really good. But I will be honest, I'm not an audiophile so my opinion may not hold much sway.I want to emphasize the comfort. I can't wear earbuds or on-ear headphones. They hurt my ears so much!

Another great product from Skullcandy",4.0,ScottyB,2025-06-26,"I have solely used Skullcandy headphones for well over ten years (JLabs for earpods) and these are pretty sick. I was hearing a white noise when the noise cancellation was turned off but nothing when it was turned on and I was confused until I realized the ""white noise"" was the air conditioner I was standing beside that I could not hear at all when the noise cancellation was turned on. Taking the headphones off while noise cancellation is on can even be disorienting. The ear cups fit my ears perfectly. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are about a half inch too short to fit the way I want, even when fully extended but thats because I have a big head. I absolutely recommend these headphones.Why did you pick this product vs others?:I am a long-time Skullcandy bluetooth headphone user (Uproar, Hesh, Hesh 2) and they have consistently given a great product at a great value even though they seem to have gotten progressively smaller over time LOLNoise cancellation:So good it can be disorienting. Not 100% of course but you will have a hard time understanding a person standing 6' away when noise cancellation is on.Value for money:I got these on a discount for $80.

fantastic headphones!",5.0,Iris Woodall,2025-05-22,"I love Skullcandy products and these headphones have been the best I've bought so far!First off, the fit is so comfortable. It's adjustable and the ear pieces rotate for an easy fit for anyone. In addition, the padding on the top makes long wear very comfortable!Second, the sound is fantastic. Every beat and every lyric. I don't know all the technical terms, but to the average, non-music expert, the sound is as good as I could ask for.Third, the battery life! 22 hours and they charge so fast.Fourth, the noise cancelling. I honestly wasn't sure what I'd think of it, but it's so great! It doesn't give you complete silence, but it blocks out all the white noise/background sound to give more focus to whatever you're doing. And it's perfect for the gym, because I don't know about y'all, but I don't need to hear other people breathing lol.These headphones are super lightweight, great quality, very easy to use, and the sound is so clear! They stay on pretty well in the gym (though I wouldn't do a whole lot of jumping in them lol) and are so comfortable for long study sessions.Highly recommend!",the United States,True,13,R39KXX407VKKVB,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Was a little disappointed as the bass doesn’t kick as hard, but they more than make up for it with the spectacular active noise canceling. SkullCandy, as always, delivers incredible quality for the money. So far they fair pretty well in rough conditions and haven’t bent or broken so the durability is certainly there.

I also like the simple visual aesthetic, no embarrassing adolescent style details. The only complaint I have is that the main button is hard to quickly find with my finger. So when someone starts talking to me, it always takes a moment to pause the music because I'm feeling around for the button.

Requires an app",2.0,Shannon Leopold,2024-10-18,"The headphones are fine. They feel kind of flimsy, and they don't include a carrying case or any sort of storage.The real annoyance is dealing with the sony app which you'll need in order to change any settings on the headphones. It has different audio settings to optimize sound quality and the only way to maximize the sound quality is through an app... in which you have no choice but to allow it to track your usage across all other apps and surprise! through a paid subscription within that app.Personally, I'm over every single thing requiring a paid subscription, and if I'm paying for headphones, the quality shouldn't be dependent on a subscription. I've already paid for the device. Pretty disappointing.Granted, you can still listen to music and they do work fine, but after doing a free trial of their ""360 audio"" and then going back it's so weird to me that you'd have to continuously pay to have your item work to it's best potential. If I could return them I would and opt for a better company, but I've missed my window and will continue to use the ""free"" lessened quality sound for casual use.",the United States,True,2,RZIHIAS44XFSH,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

These headphones phones have really small muffs, that hurt to wear. I wore them for about an hour and after I took them off my left ear was in pain for a good half hour.I also didn’t really like the buttons as they felt like they all kinds meshed together and felt the same. This would probably be resolved with use, but I found it annoying.Finally I like a bit of weight on my headphones, while these were close they are a bit light for me personally.Sound quality was good, but I won’t say too much on that as I only used them for an hour then returned them.Generally the removed stars are for the ear covers and buttons, everything else was fine and worked as intended.

A little different than our old SkullCandy headphones of the same model...",4.0,Hank Sanders,2025-08-16,"These are nice headphones, and I bought them for my husband at his request, to replace a pair he had originally purchased through SkullCandy. They appeared to be exactly the same type as his original ones, so he was disappointed when he got them upon realizing they weren't noise canceling like his original ones. He kept saying: ""These seem different"". These are sold by Amazon, which typically means that Amazon has been authorized by the original vendor to offer the vendor's product, so maybe I overlooked that these weren't noise cancelling? They do the job, but when my husband is out walking, he says he can hear traffic, whereas with his original ones, he didn't to the degree that he hears it with these. The price is good, and if you're using them in areas that don't have a lot of background noise, they should be fine. You DO NOT need any apps with these, they pair with Bluetooth on smart phones quickly. There aren't a lot of buttons to learn on the headset itself, as opposed to some SkullCandy headphones that have additional buttons, and need to pair with apps for a full experience. The quality itself seems like the original, as does the overall physical design, but again, the sound quality isn't the same as the ones he originally purchased through the SkullCandy site a few years ago even though they look and are called exactly the same thing here on Amazon, so that was a little confusing, hence the four-star review. Everything else seems fine.",the United States,True,0,R2PFJ1XLBPVGQ1,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Not to glaze or anything but I bought Beats that when compared to this are uncomfortable as heck. There's no special features like active noise canceling or transparency but I could care less. Literally didn't wear them for months (ear injury) and it somehow still had charge that I had to write this review. BUY IT if you want comfort and reliability.

My go-to headphones for the price and quality!",5.0,Jonathan Lara,2025-08-05,"These have been my go-to headphones for the last 5 years. I bought my first pair at best buy for 99.00 years ago and I broke them. Went back to best buy and got a replacement pair for free. They have a 2 year warranty (I dont know if that warranty is only at best buy or if its through the brand).When I wore out that first pair I went back and got another. Then I wore those out. So I tried branching out and getting a cheaper pair with good reviews on Amazon. I found a $25 pair with 4.8 star reviews. When I used them l, they were decent. But I got a lot of complaints from others when I called them saying I sounded very choppy.That is when I realized, for the price, these have got to be the best overall quality and most reliable headphones I've ever owned and what I choose to stick with for the foreseeable future! They only need 10 mins charge and they are almost fully charged by then and will last a couple days on a full charge depending on how much you use them. I use them about 4-6 hours per day. They're pretty rugged. I take them into the sauna and I've dropped them so many times. They only thing that starts wearing out is the ear cushion will start to tear off after a while. But thats it. Usually after a year of constant use and abuse I start noticing the cushions coming off. Regardless. I stick with these! 💪",the United States,False,0,R3E4E632PE3U5K,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

BEST HEADPHONE EVER!!!",5.0,4th Musketeer,2025-07-16,"I originally found these at Walmart a few years ago when I really needed a Bluetooth set of headphones. L-O-V-E-D them. Went back for another spare. Then went back to get one for my mom who tried mine out and loved them. By the time my cousin tried them out and decided that she wanted a pair for herself, Walmart was no longer carrying them. No prob - found on Amazon. Ended up buying a pair for another cousin + my dad for Christmas. I'm telling you - loooooooove these headphones!  No cons - just pros!!!!  Light weight,  clear great sound quality,  durable and can handle a few drops on different types of floors,  survived a dog,  soft and comfortable,  fit over ears and head - great size.  Connect well and easily to my phone,  great battery life,  plug is standard - ie. don't need specialized connecting cable to recharge.  Also - recharge is pretty fast.

Is the headset on? Why isn't it on yet? Did I press it hard enough? Oh, it's finally turned on after pressing it a couple more times. It can get quite annoying not having it turn on immediately and struggling with it.The sound is fine I guess, there is no noise canceling.Bluetooth distance is not great. If I walk to the front the of the house, it disconnects, if I walk to the back the of the house, it disconnects, even though I'm still inside the house?!?I guess some of the pros are, they don't squeeze my head too hard.

Great for the price!",5.0,Amazon Customer,2025-03-12,"Posting this review because I almost backed out of this purchase seeing some people claim they are not noise canceling. These headphones are 100% noise canceling! They do not get very loud, but because the headphones themselves block out a lot of ambient noise you do not have to max them out. The sound quality is great, battery life is long and they charge quickly. I purchased these for the gym and I can no longer hear people conversating on the equipment near me or hear the gym music blaring like I did with my Air Pod Pros. If I were to knit pick and complain about anything, it would be the size of the ear muffs. My ears have to fold a little bit to get into the headphones, but there was no discomfort during an hour and a half workout. 100% would purchase these again and highly recommend them for anyone not looking to spend a fortune on some over ear gym headphones.",the United States,True,20,RRZYRKUNYW7CW,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Works Flawlessly With My Projector!",5.0,Ron Orbital,2025-09-15,"This Bluetooth transmitter is the truth! I never even knew these things existed until I spent way too many hours trying to find a way to connect bluetooth speakers to my Epson 2150 projector. It's suppose to have a bluetooth option in the settings of the projector but it doesn't. So I found this transmitter. It fit perfectly into the audio out jack in my projector. I set it to Tx, pressed the bluetooth button on the transmitter, then on my bluetooth speaker. Functionality was flawless. Connected right away. I moved the bluetooth speaker 20ft from the transmitter and the signal strength was good. It never lagged or cut out. Portability is a great feature that I feel is underrated. It's small and doesn't get in the way of anything else. I wish this company made bluetooth earbuds or headphones.

The solution I didn't know I needed! A game-changer for travel...💯",5.0,Alx23,2025-09-03,"Let me tell you, this is one of the best little gadgets I've ever bought for my trips. I'm the type of person who likes to watch all the movies on the plane, but I can't stand the free headphones they give you—they sound terrible and make your ears hurt... 🔊​I always used to pack a pair of wired earbuds just for flights, but I'm just so used to the convenience of Bluetooth headphones now. I started searching for a solution and found this transmitter.​This thing is amazing! I used it on a recent trip, and it was a total game-changer. I connected it with the two-prong adapter it comes with to the airplane seat and was able to use my own wireless headphones. The sound was crystal-clear, with no lag, and without any annoying cables dangling in my way. The battery easily lasted the entire round trip... ⚡​The best part is the feature that lets you connect two pairs of headphones. My wife and I were able to connect both our headphones at the same time and watch the same movie. No more sharing one earbud each!!! 🤩​I've even used it at the gym to listen to the TVs there. It's small, super useful, and works perfectly. If you travel a lot or just want to turn any old device with a headphone jack into a Bluetooth device, buy this without a second thought...🎧",the United States,True,0,R24JMOR6RWWAW1,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Two pairs have stopped working within weeks",1.0,a13bc,2025-05-21,"I've purchased two pairs of these, the first because I liked the look of them and the second because I liked the sound quality. The problem is the cord is really stiff which may or may not have anything to do with it but with both pairs, within about eight weeks onthe first pair and five weeks on the second, the sound has started to cut out on one side. After about a week of this, which is extremely annoying, the sound completely dies on that side. With the first pair, the good side started crackling right after the bad side ceased to function. They're cute, I love that they fold up, they're comfortable enough though seem small even for my tiny ears but the quality just isn't there. Maybe if you wear them on a rare occasion they're fine but I'm avid audiobook listener so have these on several hours every day.

Good headphones, but physical defects not covered by warranty",1.0,Bradley Harris,2025-09-14,"These are good headphones for the sound quality. The accompanied app allows for custom equalization, so you can also adjust the levels of each band of audio exactly to your liking. The battery life is good enough to last for an entire day of use, and it recharges quickly enough that if you forget to charge the headset overnight, it will not take excessively long to charge. I enjoy the subtle color and the simple design itself looks good without being excessive.However, they have a known issue with the hinges, which break off easily. I was able to find more than 200 users posting online with this same problem, so this is a common issue that has been part of the XM4 design since the beginning. From what I can understand, this also follows into the XM5 design, where many users had the same issue. Unfortunately, the repair for this is not covered under warranty, and Sony charges near $100 to fix just the headband. As a result, I have to give this a lower rating than I would like to. This design flaw results me in knocking the score down to 1 star, since I can't recommend buying these headphones, especially considering their limited return policy.",the United States,True,2,R1A046CH1F657O,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The only plus about the XM4 is the band is more comfortable. Otherwise the XM4 is missing volume control buttons and pause/ play buttons which is upsetting to me. NC seems about the same as the 720N maybe a bit better. A big thing for me is the blue tooth connectivity the XM4 seem to really lack in this area. If I step away from my device it disconnects every time. I can’t be in a separate room while listening to my device. It also takes longer to pair the device to my computer and phone than with the 720N. I mean for 200$ this is a huge let down for me.,the United States,True,1,R7C2FCC0L910G,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The touch controls are terrible and are constantly getting triggered by a pillow behind my head or a headrest. There's no way to turn off the touch controls because Sony decided to only make that functionality available when using the headphones with a smartphone. There is no ability to turn them off when using a PC. Even worse is that the ""smart audio"" constantly cuts out when I'm using them for a zoom call. I assume it's trying to be helpful thinking I'm having a conversation with someone in the room but I'm not and it's just cutting the audio on my call over and over.

Multiple attempts were needed to find and link the devices (And yes, I'm proficient with tech), phone, tv, etc, even within 5 feet of devices. This was a consistent issue/problem.2. Latency was terrible: Once these headphones were paired, the latency was ridiculous. There was, what felt like a half to a full one second delay in audio. This was also a consistent issue/problem.I did a test comparison with jabra elite 85t earbuds and an older pair of Beats headphones, connected flawlessly with every device the sony headphones failed abismally at.

The base OMG!You’ll like it.Good job Sony!I will come back for an updated review after I try it but it’s came with a case, charger and another cord. But dont hesitate to buy it.My AirPod Max has a new friend now 🥳",the United States,True,1,R22VALSSQ4DFRC,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Not enough noise canceling",3.0,Cat of the Green Mtns,2025-08-23,"I ordered these for the noise canceling.  I work in a noisy office where there might be 3 phone conversations happening within 15 feet, and a group meeting across the hall.  However, the noise canceling feature starts with a series of chiming and tuning sounds that I found loud and highly irritating.  Once past that, the noise canceling did not do much for radio noise or even the meows of a medium-pitch cat.  Passive ear protection such as used for weed whacking is vastly better for the noise I need to block.  They offered good blocking for basic fabric or crinkly paper sounds but did very little for human voices.  Maybe the pair I got was not up to snuff, or maybe it was operator error, but I need sound dampening without any futzy aps and to be ready to go out of the box.

Loved the previous version; I love these more",5.0,GSM,2025-08-19,"I had a previous version of this headset and loved that I could connect via Bluetooth or wired. They were very comfortable, had good sound (I am not an audiophile and don't listen to music), and had good battery life as long as I remembered to turn them off when done.I love these more for reasons that I haven't seen mentioned.1. Automatic turn off. If I take them off and set them down, they will turn themselves off at some point.2. Automatic cancel noise cancelling. When one Bluetooth, if I start talking, the noise cancelling turns off.3. The noise cancelling seems better.It will be interesting to see if this model lasts longer than the previous model. I had purchased them as a 2-for-1 price on January 3, 2021. I went through both pair in the ensuing four and three-quarters years.

They charge lasts forever, I forget to charge them for days at a time and still have life left in them. The size is fine, only get slight discomfort after wearing them all day but it’s not too bad. I wear them on planes and it takes out most of the noise and I’m able to relax (I’m a nervous flier). Never had any issues connecting them to my phone, the buttons help with letting you know your battery life and toggling the noise cancelling on and off. Volume is perfect, I can turn it up as loud as I want and block out the rest of the world. Makes me feel like I’m in a music video or a movie. You can also swipe on the side to control the volume or the previous/next song. Color is cute, I wish it came in more colors but gray is neutral and nice. Overall, I love these headphones!!! Sometimes the noise cancelling will turn off if it thinks you’re talking and makes it so you can hear the other person but I click a button and it goes back to normal",the United States,True,5,R2GVHX49TGSUGM,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

The perfect headphones",5.0,Amazon Customer,2025-08-14,"Absolutely incredible! Worth the price! I'm hearing old songs like they are brand new. The depth, range and quality is remarkable, especially for the price. I've bought more expensive headphones that did way less. I have listened to certain songs for decades and I feel like I am now hearing them for the first time. I'm hearing small details I've never heard before.

Honest Review – Not Worth the Money",1.0,The Link,2025-08-07,"I wouldn’t recommend buying this. It feels cheaply made and isn’t very durable. The sound quality is just okay—not impressive—and after a year of use, the entire headset is falling apart.I sweat a lot, and that seems to have ruined the material quickly. The battery life isn’t great either, barely lasts 20 hours, and that drains fast with regular use.The fit is uncomfortable. It constantly slips off my ears, even when adjusted to the lowest setting. If you have a smaller head or not much hair, it probably won’t stay on well. It seems better suited for larger head sizes.You can honestly find better quality for a cheaper price elsewhere.Bottom line: If you’re considering Raycon, skip the budget options. You really have to invest in the higher-end models—because in this case, cheap definitely means cheap.Unfortunately, this one turned out to be a disappointment.",the United States,False,1,R15TMY6ZRCKH6B,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I can't wear earbuds for personal reasons, and it's really difficult to find decent headphones. The actual earphone piece swivels, so the design really adjusts to your head shape, which makes it slightly more accessible for those who are hypersensitive. The sound quality is amazing.

I am not able to do this with other headphones.  I usually have to disconnect from one before connecting to another. Nice perk! I would definitely buy these again ir even give them as gifts.",the United States,True,2,R1HNF9RCSUM4SS,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

After more than half a year of using experience...",3.0,Mr.Unknown,2025-07-08,"Despite giving it 3 stars, this is definitely a quality headset that people should strive for within budget, comparable to quite a lot of headsets out there that are up to $150 in value (Well, a personal estimate). For using it for more than half a year now, I'm here to spill the beans.Pros: Very good price to valueI got mine at $70, and I believe they are constantly on discount anyway, so let's just say it is firm $70 for anyone to purchase them.1. The headset has got the quality sounds that the company claims to be, it is not going to be deep and rich but after some time of cooking, it will handle most sound ranges with ease, I'll recommend it to anyone who isn't too crazy about their hearing experience.2. The battery life is also amazing, you can definitely get it up to 2 full days of use if you do turn off the headset when not utilizing it, 40 hours is a bit of exaggeration, from my experience it is about 35-ish.3. The cushion of the headset is fairly comfortable and able to surround your entire ear, the tension from the headband gives just enough pressure to ensure wearing comfort and leaving practically no air gaps, giving you a fairly nice amount of outside sound blocking before utilizing ANC.4. The fact that Raycon left an Audio Jack that allows you to use this headset with wire in case if you want no audio latency or accidently ran out of juice, it is a huge plus in my book, very consumer friendly.Cons: Theres a lot of small annoyance about their software design1. The headset has a voice notification that let you know its status, for example it will say ""power on"" when you turn the device on and ""power off"" for vise versa. Sure it is good to know whats state of usage it is on, but if you are to go from normal usage to turn on ANC, it will completely mute out whatever audio source that is coming in, WITHOUT PAUSING, until the sound message of ""ANC mode, on"" completely plays out, same thing goes for the awareness mode and turning special modes off. So if you are in a important video call or meeting of some sort, DO NOT CHANGE MODES or you might miss some important keywords from your presenter.2. The ANC and awareness modes are practically useless. ANC mode does not drown out enough sound at all, it more or less makes you feel like you are in a wind tunnel from the noise it is making, it really doesn't help if you want to have a clear listening to something in a loud setting, at that point might as well crank up the audio level because it is easier that way and it doesnt pause your audio. Awareness mode as well, it just makes your surrounding sounds like something coming from a boosted microphone, sound is not clear and noise heavy, which also hinders playback mid usage.3. There are 2 different audio playback modes, stereo and AUX, where the headset's built-in microphone only works with AUX mode (or Voice Call mode). I have VoiceMeeter and Nvidia Broadcast setup in my computer to reroute my audios for better sound experience and voice call. For something simple like a Discord voice call, if I want to use the headset's mic with the headset's stereo playback, the headset will not play any sound at all, only if I route the audio to the headset's AUX output then I can hear my peers talking. That itself is an issue because the audio level for stereo and AUX are not synced, which usually result to the sound coming from AUX audio being extra loud and peaking. And because the headphone is playing back audio in AUX mode, if i'm to play some songs in the background or have a video going on the side, they would sound like something coming from a phone call. I personally use an external microphone for majority of the time where this is not too big of a concern, but if you are a buyer who is looking for good playback quality within calls and want to utilize the built-in microphone, you might want to look somewhere else.I'll not be talking about the playback features or connection related features on the headset buttons since I don't utilize them often enough to give a solid opinion.Lastly, In my opinion, I'll say this headset is a no-brainer pick for a quality budget that is less than $100, if you can look pass the software problems. Hope this review helps.",the United States,True,2,R2MDVQFZ4I8WOB,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I will never use this headset.",1.0,Paul Green,2025-06-30,"I will never use this headset. It was meant for practicing on my Roland Juno-DS 88 synthesizer. But the Raycon everyday headphones are incompatible with keyboard synthesizers. When playing on an electric keyboard synthesizer the key sound is out of sync it has a disturbing delay effect. I tried it once or twice. I may have tested it because of its delayed effect on a keyboard synthesizer. It only works for listening pleasure. It's still in the box, and of no use to me. It is a huge loss of investment. I wish I could return this product. It is of no use to me. I am sorely dissatisfied.",the United States,True,1,R3GNE2G6DEP3I7,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Worse Than Skullcandy, Double the Price.",2.0,Peter B.,2025-06-24,"The construction is good and comfortable, and the audio quality is passable. I cannot recommend this however, as I have had better wireless headphones for triple the price, and half the price. You can get a 60-80 dollar pair of Skullcandys with a heavier bass, cleaner audio, and an actual functioning active noise cancelling and ambiance mode. My Sony headphones of course blows both of these out of the water, but that's 250 whereas this is 100. Not to mention that the half-as-expensive Skullcandy headphones had more than double the range for Bluetooth. With them I could literally cross my whole house and be fine, I can barely leave the room with these before it starts to lose connection.I can not overstate just how useless the noise cancelling and ambiant mode is on these things. They should be polar opposites when it comes to background noise and yet they're barely destinguishable. I knew Raycon was a gamble with their ear buds audio quality being so poor but I should've learned my lesson the first time and just stuck with Skullcandy for premium quality cheap headphones.",the United States,True,0,R3MVBP7S34YZC9,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Excellent set of headphones!  The mint green and lavender are so girlish and fun, I love it!!  Absolutely love the squishy foam that goes over the top of the head for comfort.

Fantastic headphones",5.0,Customer Review,2025-05-09,"I love this and my kid does too!I prefer a wired headphone to wireless because I think it’s safer for kids (given some concerns I e heard about wireless too close to the kids body). And this way with wired I don’t need to recharge any batteries or worry about the dangers of lithium batteries.These headphones fold very flat making it portable for travel. It’s also really flexible and fits my two-year-old’s bigger than average head nicely.I like the option to turn on or off the volume limiting through buttons on the wire - the biggest complaint I’ve heard from parents is volume limiting is very ineffective in planes since kids can barely hear through the engine noise.The headphone jack (instead of USB C) is perfect for my Yoto mini player.Best of all, Acer is a recognizable and well regarded electronics brand that I trust.",the United States,False,1,R5A1IAZFCN5GR,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great and comfortable headphones",5.0,Chan,2025-05-07,Excellent quality headphones. I purchased this for my kid's classroom which was a part of the school supplies list for next year.  The sound quality is crisp and not muffled and you can adjust to a lower decibel by using the switch in the instructions.  The headphones are very comfortable and padded and can fit around the ears without irritation. I recommend this for the general student use.

Safe and comfortable for daily use in the school and travel",5.0,Jensen,2025-05-06,"The wired kids' headphone is designed with parents' priorities in mind. They feature a crucial volume limiter, safeguarding children's hearing by restricting the maximum sound level. The over-ear design provides comfort, while the foldable feature ensures easy storage and portability. They are equipped with a 3.5mm jack for broad compatibility with various devices, chromebook or tablet, making them versatile for learning and entertainment. Acer is a good and large brand of computer and IT company with good reputation. I would suggest the product for parents.For your kids, these headphones offer a safe and enjoyable listening experience. The comfortable design is perfect for long periods of use, whether they're watching videos, listening to music, or participating in online learning. The durable construction and fun color options will appeal to children, making these headphones a best choice for everyday use and school.",the United States,False,0,R24NIRQ1RI763A,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

It's not a huge deal to me since it doesn't impact how I wear them...at all, lol. I'm not constantly folding them up since they stay at home for my desktop but I can foresee it becoming an issue if you do travel with these and fold them up a lot.Honestly?

Cute and Light but so uncomfortable!!!",2.0,Stephanie,2025-03-03,These are very cute and very light which were big reasons for getting them. However the cushions surrounding the ear are not thick enough so your ears are pressed up against the cushion and the headphones themselves.

Great performing Headset!",5.0,Aaron J,2025-03-13,"The mic switch on my Rig 400 headset stopped working recently.  I figured, let me see what out there for cheaper headsets, so I hopped on Amazon to see what was available.  Thankfully, I came across this headset!  I've had this headset for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's performed well above my expectations!  This headset packs a punch.  Compared to my Rig, these actually pump out more bass with the 50mm drivers vs the 40mm in the Rig.  In some cases, the Rig 400 produced a bit better highs than these Nubwo's, but that's a rarity and nothing an Eq app can correct.  Overall, I much prefer this headset's sound profile to the more expensive Rig 400 that I had prior. Keep in mind, this headset doesn't offer swivel earcups, but these have fit me perfectly fine and have been super comfy for long periods of play for me.  If you're debating picking these up, don't hesitate and just do it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",the United States,False,0,R3UUKBY69D8YMJ,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

For these headphones I was expecting top quality, but after only 6 months the Bluetooth stopped working completely. They no longer enter pairing mode, don’t connect to any of my devices, and even a factory reset doesn’t fix the problem. At this point they only work with the cable, which defeats the whole purpose of wireless headphones. This seems to be a known issue with this model. Sad to see how products are made with a planned obsolescence and they just design products to fail over time.

Worst headphones I've ever owned. Uncomfortable, horrible settings, and they DON'T WORK!",1.0,Reviewer from Michigan,2025-09-07,"1. They aren't NEARLY as comfortable on the top of your head as the 3 or 4 because Sony cut down significantly on the padding.2. You can't fold them like the 3 and 4, which is SUPER INSANELY annoying.3. The padding even on the EARS is reduced from the 3 and 4!4. Sony added a lot of things as default settings that used to be optional settings, and the ONLY way to change them is to sync the headphones up to your phone, download the app, and change the settings there. And I absolutely HATE that app. I intended on only using these on my computer and my TV, not on my phone, so this was a BIG problem for me.5. Sony changed from the soothing female voice on the 3 to a douchey male voice - and you cannot change it.6. They rotate UP, so when you take them off and pull them down on your neck, the hard plastic (and all of the touch controls) are painfully ON YOUR COLLARBONE - instead of the soft earpads, like the model 3.7. The final nail in the coffin: I was watching TV and they were constantly going in and out, multiple times PER SECOND.I returned them. These are the worst headphones I've ever owned, and by far the worst thing I've ever owned made by Sony. I'm going to see if I can track down a good price on a model 4 instead, or maybe even... a competitor ☹️",the United States,False,0,R1LCA024QB8MJR,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

They turn off randomly even at full battery.

No longer a fan of Sony and their headphones.",1.0,T,2025-09-04,"The Good: When it works, it sounds great. Clarity is good. I have gotten used to the controls.The Bad:* Active Noise Cancelling (ANC or ANR) is inconsistent. You could be listening to something (music, movies, YouTube, etc.) and suddenly the noise cancelling gets reduced by almost 50%, and I can hear my environment. The first version I got was so bad that any sounds that I make while (clearing my throat, talking out loud) suddenly makes the noise cancelling toggle to a different mode that suddenly turns down the subtle white noise that comes with ANC, and suddenly pipes the environment in. The replacement I got from Sony was a bit better; but it still toggles noise-cancelling in an incredibly annoying manner.* Sudden disconnects (unpairing) and power-offs. Had this problem with the original unit AND the replacement. I have not been able to replicate the issue in a consistent manner. Sometimes I can go for hours before it suddenly disconnects and powers off. Sometimes, it happens right away. And, yes, Sony replaced the original version with a similar model. And, the day that the new version arrived, it disconnected 3 times. Today (09/04/2025), I called Sony after the replacement headset exhibited the same intermittent connections and was told ""There is nothing that we can do about it."" The implication is that I have no more recourse (no replacements or no refunds). I hear you say ""well, its your fault that you stuck with the product way past the 30-day return window"". To this, I say, I have had the XM4 for a few years, and had not had any of these issues. So, when I first experienced this problem, I trusted the brand so much that I figured that it was a one-off. And so, I gave it much more benefit-of-doubt than I would give any other brands. By the time I realized that this is a systematic issue, the 30-day return window was up. Sony's customer representatives also made it clear that purchasing Sony headphones from the ""Sony Amazon store"" leads to poorer warranty. Basically, it seemed that they could help me a bit better if I had bought it directly from Sony than from Amazon.* The original XM5 headphones received had the most wrinkly ear cups that I had ever seen in a headphone product. The replacement product was better. But, it is worth nothing that both XM4 and XM5s ear cups get quite uncomfortable (and sweaty) after about an hour of use.* The headphone case is absolutely terrible relative to the more svelte XM4 setup.",the United States,True,1,R33DV9Z7ANDZMC,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

I feel like I overpaid =(",3.0,PiyoPiyo,2025-08-13,"So this came highly reviewed from multiple influencers. KEEP IN MIND - Sound is very subjective.But my headphones history includes older Sony Headphones, along to Koss, Senheisser, and Bose.I'm no audiophile by anymeans - but this pair.. just sounds muddy/muffled to me. The active and passive noise cancellation is good but I've had dangerously better.So one of the MAIN reasons why I got this - So I dont hear the mower when I mow. Active or Passive I can hear the mower - its very reduced - but still noticable.The Bose QC10's I had which is purely active noise reduction - did a better job at blocking motor noise.This is dangerously active as I cant hear anything external of me.TLDR: Not blown away by the quality of music I get out of this pair, Noise Cancellation is mediocre (for me), But the price I paid is at if not more than something else that would probably get me more for my money.For me this was a bad investment.",the United States,True,0,RCPG08RUDLP5A,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great Headphones",5.0,Richard Kang,2025-08-13,"It's great. It's Sony, and they know how to make quality products.Battery life is good, I tend to forget that these need to be charged. And when I do charge, the quick charge function is great.Sound quality is good. If you want to change the EQ, the app allows you to make those changes. Although, I personally don't care about making changes to the EQ.Primarily use it for when I'm at a cafe or need to tune out background noise. Definitely solid in terms of that.I will say my two biggest so-called gripes would be that it takes up a lot of space in my bag, especially in the carrying case. But that's what the new updated ones are for. And secondly, after a couple hours of use I tend to get ear fatigue. My ears, not my hearing, get sensitive and the crown of my head as well (or wherever the band is resting on).Other than that, I definitely recommend these headphones. I haven't looked into the MX-6, other than the folding. But from what I can see, it's basically just the MX-5's with folding and AI Noise reduction, which sure, if you think those features are worth the extra $100, then go for it.Quick Disclaimer: If you tend to have more oily skin or hair, I would recommend staying away from the black options. Maybe go for the silver option, I believe the cups' material or finish is textured on those, so you won't notice the oils on them as much compared to the black option, unless you don't mind having to clean them off.",the United States,True,0,R2INL9D060XNRH,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Really good, but surprising quality control issues mean you should wait for a good deal",4.0,Dan The Man,2025-08-06,"I got a good deal on these for <200, replacing my ancient Plantronics Backbeat 2 cans.

Low-latency with all of my gear from Samsung to Nvidia Shield to my PCs- Noise-canceling is truly a marvel. I can't hear anything with these on.- Very comfortable for hours of use.- Decent microphone quality- Feature-rich with multi-point, customizable EQ in app, and dozens of other quality of life improvements- Huge Bluetooth range!- Nice case is included- Great battery life- The blue color is muted and tasteful, while adding a bit of pizzazz over the default black color.Neutral:- Touch controls are never preferable to buttons, but these seem to work pretty well and are responsive on all the platforms I've tested.Cons:- Surprising bugs: They seem to randomly go to sleep at times. They say they're connected to my Windows PC but have no audio until I disconnect and re-pair them. Plenty of other people online complaining about the same issues. My 12 year old Plantronics have none of this drama!

Perfect headphones for sensitive ears.",5.0,Elizabeth,2025-07-30,"These are my first full-sized, higher-end headphones. Before this, I had JBLs for about $100 and the sound was decent, but I have very sensitive ears, and after just 1–1.5 hours of wearing them, my ears and even my head would start to hurt.For the same reason, I had to switch from AirPods Pro to Shokz OpenFit 2, because Apple earbuds gave me dizziness and ear pain after a while. I also tested Apple Max headphones and Sonos Ace – they all looked nice but clamped too hard and their noise cancellation literally made me nauseous. My vestibular system is extremely sensitive, so I usually avoid strong ANC.Surprisingly, Sony’s noise cancellation feels magical. It doesn’t make me dizzy at all. Whether it’s on or off, I’m totally comfortable, which has never happened with other brands.Even though these are full-sized and naturally press on the head a bit, my ears never start hurting! That alone feels like a big win for me!Sound quality is amazing. I tweaked the equalizer and got a sound that gives me goosebumps every time. That’s how I know it’s great. I’m not an audiophile, but I know good sound when I feel it, and these deliver perfectly.Overall, I’m extremely happy with this purchase and have zero regrets about choosing these over Sonos or Apple. Finally, a pair of headphones that sound incredible, feel comfortable for hours, and have noise cancellation that doesn’t mess with my balance.",the United States,True,19,R1VNU3LIKDEVPY,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

DON’T BUY SONY HEADPHONES",1.0,Evan Smith,2025-07-23,"DO NOT BUY. Lack of durability due to a hinge on the headband has shown by many to make these useless. Even under the 1 year manufacturer warranty, this issue is not covered. If you haven’t come across this yet, just google sony headphones hinge issue and you’ll see many others like me who have experienced this.After 9 months of normal use and taking care of them quite well, I put them in one day and noticed the hinge had essentially broken. As a result, the right ear wouldn’t sit on my ears. This makes them useless. I reached out to Sony knowing I had a 1 year warranty as part of my purchase and they let me know this was considered “physical damage” and that type of damage is not covered under their warranty.Luckily, because I bought them through Amazon, I’m able to get a full refund from Amazon directly. But, as far as the product goes, you could find yourself spending hundreds of dollars on headphones that become useless within a year or two. Shame because as far as headphones go these really are the best in my opinion. But, because of this experience and many others who have faced the same, I won’t be buying a Sony product again.",the United States,True,5,R1TLNKTEQ5ANU1,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

It was a good product",4.0,Evee,2025-07-22,"I really liked this product, but I did not like the color. I thought the color would be more of a true Mauve but it's really a white-grey pink. I think it's worth the money if you get it on sale.Bluetooth connect connectivity was really great but I did notice that whenever I got on a social media app say like TikTok or Instagram there would be a good 2 to 3 second delay before it would catch on. So if your music was playing it would delay for 2 to 3 seconds and then catch on that you're on social media likewise, if you switch from social media app to your music again there was a delay as well. I didn't get to try it with like movies or Netflix or YouTube so I can't speak for that, I also only kept them for about one day.It was really easy to use downloading the app was quick and easy, to download I would say that setting up everything you need or like setting up the equalizer is easy but you need a little bit of time and patience. You're gonna need at least 10-15 minutes to do that.Another thing I would say is that the sound quality out of the box does not compare to my AirPod Pro 2, I found that it was lacking in base and treble, I have a feeling that if you liked watching or listening to podcasts, that sound profile would be really good for you. It was just bleh out of the box, but once I use the equalizer and I was able to customize it to my preferences, it worked great. Again I think the product is good. I just returned it because I realized I wanted the XM6 instead. Also, I didn't get a chance to try it with phone calls either so I can't speak on that.",the United States,True,0,R3KNDO12OMN0KS,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

It can be hard to tell what reviews are real/fake so here is my unbiased opinion:Pros:- really good sound quality- noise canceling does work pretty well- fit both my 3 year old and myself (adult)- VERY comfortable (super nice thick foam)- looks high quality- fast shipping- Good condition- Great Price I got these on sale but retails looks like it would be $50 and it is worth that price even off sale if you can’t wait!Cons:- hair can catch in the parts that turn- while i love the colors of the one we got, I do wish they had a wider variety of options to choose from.These are all based on first impressions so cannot speak to battery life yet",the United States,True,15,R12QUBAQVTWPV3,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Great, cheaper than many alternatives, works similarly",5.0,Katerina,2025-02-04,"These headphones provide excellent quality at the price point they are at.

She has been using them alternately and says they feel the same to her. I tried them on and I actually like the level of comfort of these slightly better than the Bose and the noise cancellation on these is slightly worse than the Bose.

Good kids headphones at a good price",5.0,Sandshark,2024-12-28,"My granddaughter really likes using these with her tablet.  The headphone jack on her Android tablet quit working, so we decided to get a Bluetooth set instead of repairing the aging tablet.  She liked the color and the full over-ear style, so we chose these.  And now that she's used them, she says they sound better than her (not very expensive) old wired ones and she really likes not having the cord.  She's six, but small for her age, and they are just tight enough at the smallest adjustment, so I can't recommend for anyone under five.  I won't try them on my big size 8 head, but they look like they should fit her up to her early teens.  She made one longish car trip with her tablet but without headphones and her mom kept telling her to turn it down.  Now, she has these and that's not going to be a problem on the next trip.I asked if she could tell the difference when the ANC is on vs. off, and she said they sounded ""different"", but couldn't really say if it was ""better"".  But we've not used them in a noisy environment and the over-the-ear style already blocks low noise.  But that's something difficult for a first grader to assess and I can't even say for sure she really hears any difference.  But so far, they've let her use her tablet in peace.I like that they do have a volume limiter to keep her from blasting it (intentionally or accidentally).  The corded capability is a bonus for us -- nice to have if needed to temporarily use them with another device or in a plane, but not what we got them for or have used yet.  One thing that the instructions state that the listing does not is that the ANC does not work in corded mode.The construction seems good and the price is right for headphones of this quality.  They only get a couple hours of use a day at most, and get plugged in at night, so I can't really evaluate the battery life fairly.",the United States,False,1,R1WEL1K2GIWFYM,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Affordable kids' headphones with ANC",5.0,James Lin,2024-12-19,"The iClever BTH26 headphones are a pretty decent pair of headphones with active noise cancelling that actually works!  We need a pair of headphones for our toddler to use on an upcoming flight, and these seem perfect.  I tested the ANC at home by turning on some loud white noise on a speaker, and the headphones definitely filter out the lower frequencies.  I'll be sure to test them out on the airplane to see how well they work in a much louder environment.These headphones are pretty chunky, so they're great for older kids and ok for toddlers.  The max volume limit is always a nice feature, and the 80dB max is totally fine, even for adults to use.  The price is a bit higher than other kids' headphones, but the ANC support and the solid build quality justify it.UPDATE:  We tested out these headphones on a flight, and they worked great.

Looks good, quite comfortable and ANC actually works, seems louder than 80db",4.0,Dada,2024-12-03,"These iClever BTH26 headphones are very cute, controls are easy to access and they seem fairly durable for being all plastic.We tested noise cancelling by turning on a nearby fan then switched the active noise cancelling on and the  change was immediately noticeable, but not completely eliminated.  In other words, it's much better than nothing but don't expect it to perform like higher end ANC headphones.  When the ANC button is pressed, an announcement is made that the feature has been turned on or off and there's no way to suppress this announcement.  Also, the headphones retain the last setting for ANC even if the headphones are powered off then back on.  For example, if you had turned on ANC then turned off the headphones, the next time you turn on the headphones, ANC would still be on.Sound quality wise, it's fine for kids, not the rich highs or thundering bass you would expect from premium headphones; but most likely the target audience for this product doesn't care.  One area of concern for me is that they do get quite a bit louder than I had expected and there is no way to manage what that upper volume limit is on the headphones themselves.Overall, it's nice to see Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) on more headphones targeted for children instead of headphones that overcome noise by simply increasing volume.

They also look great, which is a bonus. Pairing them was a breeze; it took only a few seconds to connect them to their tablet.The sound quality is good for a pair of headphones at this price point. While they don’t rival high-end noise-canceling models, the audio clarity and depth are excellent for $60. The volume limiter is nice too, so I don't need to check every video before letting them watch anything on a plane. The noise cancellation works pretty well too -- which also keeps them from needing to turn up the audio too much to hear.I've only had them for a few days, but they seem like they are durably made, and seem to have a long battery life - BONUS!",the United States,False,3,R2ANH7FHAVJSBG,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Works perfectly!",5.0,Stacy,2024-11-13,"I had no issues pairing these Bluetooth headphones. Once I charged the headphones, I simply turned it on and located the device (iClever) on my phone's Bluetooth settings, and it automatically connected. I was ready to use the headphones immediately after without any issues. I did try pushing the ANC button, but didn't really notice a difference in noise cancelling when I had it turned on and off. Regardless, the headphones do a good job of projecting the sound, so I don't think my son will have an issue with hearing when using it in loud, public spaces.I love that it also comes with an auxiliary cable to use in case the battery runs out. Now I don't have to worry about the headphones dying in the middle of my son's screen time when we're out.These are the first Bluetooth headphones that I've tried for my son, and it's been super convenient.

So far she has used it for air, rail and car travel and there have been no complaints.The battery lasts a long time and since everything is USB C now, they are very convenient and easy to charge.The sound is on the bassy side which works well for the music that kids listen to and watching videos on Disney+.The volume limiting feature also works well along with the weaker noise cancelling creating less pressure on little ears.There is no high-res codec support, AI assisted noise cancelling or any of that high-end stuff here. If these are important to you, there are other options on Amazon priced much higher (not sure if I can name them).Overall I am satisfied with these and would happily buy another pair if anything happened to them.For the price paid not much to complain about here.",Canada,True,0,RWSFZMGNLPM3D,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Used for my kids’ headphones that fold, so fold one side up, leave the other down, and there’s enough space for a charger or two when traveling.

High quality audio with a super long battery and comfortable fit.",5.0,WirEZenD,2025-08-24,"I use these every day, sometimes more than 48hrs at a time.  I charge them about every 2 weeks.  I'm half deaf so I'm running them kinda loud and still get long battery life.  The sound quality is also amazing.  If you use 3D spacial audio, these headphones go to the next level.  Once you get your software tuned, the immersive, high quality sound will put you right in the center of the experience.Their build quality is superb.  I have never had a set of over ear headphones last this well.  There isn't a pulled stitch.  There isn't a worn band or a busted speaker swivel.  I wear glasses with a thick frame and usually tear through comfortable ear-cups in a few months.  After all my usage, there is only a slight scuff where my glasses rest.  This is the ONLY wear I have seen since purchase.  Also, they charge while in use so you don't have to stop.

They are light, and feel cheap, I don't know how long they will last, but so far they are okay.  My biggest complaint is that the ear covers pivot and swivel, there is no tension in these connections, so when you take them off they flop allover.  You need to spend a few seconds when you put them on to figure out which way to untwist and flip them.

Get ready to melt your face off!!!!!",5.0,Tom Cassity,2025-06-18,Holy shiitake mushrooms these sound amazing!!!!  I can’t believe how a sub $50 and in my case sub $25 (I bought used because I was seriously skeptical) headset sounds so good.  In comparison my wife has the Sony 1000xm4’s. I would put the sound quality on these above the Sony. However the Sony wins the comfort and noise cancellation since the OneOdio doesn’t have it. But consider that I paid $350 for the Sonys and $22.50 for the OneOdie I’d say that on the overall value for your buck these kick butt.

2 Years Later (Almost)",5.0,MotionlessZero,2025-06-09,"I got these back in July of 2023. I've gotta say that these held up. There is a weird bend in the headband that I actually kind of remember just being there. I'm very sure it wasn't when I got these so, that's on me. Otherwise their durability has been great.Battery Life? I haven't noticed any downside yet. I wear them consistently from any between 2 - 6 hours of use. I will go  W E E K S  without needing to charge them. Sound is still just as good as the day I got them. I got mine on sale for around $30, I would still pay full price for these. They are a great pair if not for the battery life alone. Great value for money. I have a pretty big head, and not just metaphorically. They fit well and my ears don't get annoyed from them resting on my head for the 2 - 6 hours of daily usage.Overall, I think these are a great buy.

THE PERFECT SET OF CANS... From a Guitarist/Vocalist Perspective.",5.0,BBILB,2025-05-27,"So first things first I like to test out the basics of any new headphones I get using online audio resources, and when I put the OneOdio's to the test everything they stated on their website and amazon ads are pretty much accurate to their specs.Cans; OneOdio Model Y80BBass Hz; does reach just below 20hz.Treble Hz; does reach 20k.Bass sweep; PassedL/R Stereo; -0 DeviationBinaural; PassedRelative Polarity; L/R Drivers passed + panningBass + delay; PassedBass +100/Treble +5; PassedAudible Freq; 15200hz (Capped by internet compression)Summary; General Purpose Audio, quality dependent on equipment.The results of this test were done online using an online resource and should not be considered a scientific result, all online resources pretty much cap out at an Audible Frequency of 15khz no matter what headphones or DAC you are using, the reason is due to processing digital code to an audio signal will always have missing audio some of which is in perceivable to your hearing through a digital medium. Streaming services are notorious for bad audio streaming quality, I don't care what they say, pick your streaming service, their audio quality is horrible.During my years of recording vocals and guitar at home, I had the time to do deep dives into Realtek codecs and CD vs. MP3 forums about audio replication stats and if there is one thing I have discovered is that there is in fact flagrant missing data when it comes to replicating tone and timbre of vocals and instruments. The introduction of FLAC vindicates my assertion that MP3's have always sucked and that I've always been right since the days of Napster.As a guitar player and avid headphone user, my advice is this, I've tried all the big name brand headphones you will find on amazon and none of them have impressed me as much as a recording studio with a good set of powered speakers, I said good speakers, not uber expensive speakers. I feel the same about headphones, and when it comes to headphones and what you are trying to replicate really comes down to the room the audio is recorded in, and no matter how much you pay for a set of cans it will NEVER EVAR reflect the same audio image AS THE ARTIST INTENDED because the air is isolated in the cans and not moving freely around your head.Headphones will always focus audio directly into your ear canals, not around your body as the artist originally intended, which is why pro studios do not use headphones to mix or to sum audio, they use powered amps and drivers, and that is something your over priced headphones are not. For instance listening to your favorite music through a pair of ear buds is not the same experience as listening to your favorite music in a car with a quality amp and audio speakers, the interior of the vehicle always effects the quality of the audio, just as the room your favorite music was recorded in effected the audio. In essence, the environment is an extension of the instruments and vocalist and plays a huge massive part in audio recording, and that is something a pair of headphones will always and forever fail to replicate accurately.With all that being said are the OneOdio Headphones worth it? The simple answer is Yes. Any over the ear headphone at any price that is designed like the OneOdio over ear closed cans is great for general purpose listening and I would say they are comparable to cans I would deem way overpriced name brand plastic junk which they pretty much all are, In my experience they are all just different designs that don't add anything for the consumer to rave about when it comes to audio quality (I don't care if it comes with an app or Dolby Wateva), the only ones raving and ranting are the same people writing the sales pitches and hype blogs.You can basically pick any over the ear headphone out there and you will be happy with them because from my experience with all the music forums that I have visited over the years I have never met anyone one who has ever said they were ever blow away or found the perfect set of cans. What is perfect for you is subjective, pick your favorite style, make sure your happy with the fit and finish first, and then try playing around with the audio quality of the cans to find what works best for you.The OneOdio's will serve you well in this regard, I plug them into my TV and I can listen in Dolby Atmos and they got a good sound stage for that, not as great as my open backs, I recommend open backs for home theater use because the sound stage is more expansive, closed back cans are going to be too focused and boomy down your ear canals, and that will fatigue you over time. Remember what I said about comfort, fit, and finish, headphones should offer a comfortable listening experience, audio quality is secondary, the audio is always going to suck if you're not comfortable wearing the headphones for long listening periods. So think comfort before style or audio quality.So far I like the OneOdio's, I don't care for the pleather ear pads, but those are replaceable. Some people may be comfortable with them others not so much. So if you don't know where to start you should start with being mindful of price vs. performance and the OneOdio's seem to have that niche market covered with several different offerings suitable for all budgets and needs, so yeah, I would recommend OneOdios if you need an affordable quality set of cans that sound great and don't require you to sell a kidney to impress your fake friends. 5***** Stars",the United States,True,24,R28LEV2JSFZKIV,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

3 years and counting.",5.0,Jacob,2025-05-03,"I'm very twitchy about my audio. I like punchy, I like clear, I like bass in my hip hop and kicks in my metal. I like hearing the pick hit the strings in my country and each voice in a chorus.I can confidently say these are still the best over ear headphones I've ever had and I just keep coming back to them. I'm writing this review after I bought JBL tune 770's and Bose QC and being thoroughly disappointed that they couldn't compete. The base of these shakes my head and I can hear each instrument even with the base running heavy and smooth.To fully grasp my search for good quality, I have a box of over 30 pairs of earbuds tips, all from earbuds I've bought in search for the best. I'm very particular.My music range is quite literally everything.Deathcore to hip hop to country to sea shanties to rock/metal to edm to beatbox to tavern music.I like my music loud and the 50mm drivers deliver where all else seems to continuously fail. They're loud and clear.The comfort is doable. I feel like the padding could be better and I wish the headphones would hug my head tighter but again, I've had these 3 years by now and they show no signs of giving up. Longest I've worn them was 5 hours straight.I don't care about noise cancelling since I only use these in my room where it's nice and quiet and the music is loud enough to be my noise cancelling anyways.The battery life is great, sometimes I don't have to charge it for 2-3 weeks and they charge seemingly pretty quick.They swap between my phone and PC pretty well when they're connected to both.Overall, I just keep coming back to them no matter what higher price or ""better quality"" headphones I buy. Hang up your headphones when not in use and they'll live a long life.

Unique Design, Horrible Function",1.0,Kevin,2025-05-02,"I was obsessed with the look of the OneOdio Pro-30s, especially that model's big, thick, ""hockey puck cut from a couch cushion"" ear pads, but I knew they wouldn't be ideal for my use case: a companion for long, loud commutes. I had to dig deep into OneOdio's catalog to find something with a similar design that fit my needs better, and this product is what I ended up going with. My compliments begin and end with the unique design. I wish headphones with better functionality with the same sleek design existed, but I don't think they do.No ANC, and the big ear cuffs surprisingly do very little to minimize outside sound to make up for this, the side buttons are cheap sounding and do not work in wired mode, and the audio quality is totally underwhelming.When I have the headphones in Bluetooth mode and connect to VOIP calls through my COMPUTER, the audio becomes very harsh and crispy, and I can not adjust the audio whatsoever. I've been using Bluetooth headphones with my computer for years, I have no idea why this is happening or how to fix it, but it's only ever happened to me using these headphones.I'm waiting for a shipment right now for better quality headphones with more functionality at the same price point (company rhymes with Hound Sore) and then I plan on returning these.Don't let the flashy design fool you.

Great Sound and Battery Life, But Hinge Could Be Better",4.0,Jackjones,2025-04-17,"These OneOdio headphones deliver a lot of value for the price. The sound is clear and full, with deep bass and strong volume thanks to the 50mm drivers. I’ve used them for music, videos, and even some light audio editing, and they’ve done a great job across the board.The battery life is definitely a standout—you can go days without needing to charge, and the wireless/wired flexibility is super convenient. I also really like the comfort level. The ear cups are soft, and the fit is nice even during longer listening sessions. They fold up well and are easy to pack for travel.That said, I’m giving 4 stars because the hinge design isn’t the most durable. After regular use, it feels like it could weaken or crack over time if you’re not careful. If you're rough with your gear or plan to use them every single day on the go, that’s something to keep in mind.Still, for the sound quality, comfort, and battery life at this price, they’re a great pick.

Sometimes it powers on right away and you don't feel like you have to press it longer but sometimes it doesn't turn on right away so it keeps you guessing. What was wrong with the old style toggle switch so you know that it's going to turn on instead of this garbage singular button? The same thing that was wrong with the previous volume buttons.

Some upgrades, some downgrades over the older Quiet Comfort models",3.0,M. Berning,2025-09-05,"Nice pair of headphones. The noise cancellation is excellent. The controls are vastly inferior to the older QC35 models. The power button is not labelled as power but rather bluetooth, which is confusing. I found the slider style power button to be more intuitive. The volume control is some haptic slider which doesn't work that well. The band adjustment no longer has any detents, so getting it perfectly even on both sides is not as clear as it used to be. I also don't care for all the various noise cancellation options. IMO it should just be on or off. It's a bit disappointing that they managed to take a nearly perfect product and devolve it.",the United States,True,0,R2E40V1B3JL312,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Disappointing - Expect smarter from Bose..",1.0,Chris,2025-09-04,"As the proud owner of an older set of Bose headphones, I have been looking forward to upgrading my Bose headphones and finally purchased the Bose QC Ultra’s. Unfortunately, Bose made some poor decisions, and Base QC Ultra’s in their present form are not for me.  Comically the sound coming out of the headphones was impressive and is not the problem.As a keyboard warrior, I wear my headphones all day long.  With noise cancellation anywhere near the maximum, it puts noticeable pressure on my ears. After a couple of hours listening to music at the lowest level possible, noise cancellation starts to give me a headache.  The problem is, if you turn down the noise cancellation to the lower levels (or off), Bose has decided that the headphones should amplify your environment’s surrounding noise.  One of the reasons for wearing over the ear headphones is to mute surrounding environmental noise from co-workers, keyboard/mouse clicks, fans, or else – and not to amply this noise so that you hear it better than if you weren’t wearing headphones at all.  Listing to your environment might be desired in some situations but definitely not all.  Other manufacturers allow you to turn down (or off) noise cancellation and not amplify surrounding noise but these Bose headphones do not support.When I called Bose technical support to question if I was missing something, the support person asked for the serial number for the QC Ultra headphones I just purchased.  When I provided, the Bose technical support person claimed the warranty for my now two-day old headphones, expired over a month prior. It appears there’s a disconnect between Bose and Amazon – but since these are going back, I’m not going to worry about.  During the call, the Bose support technician confirmed that Bose does not presently offer the feature I so desperately require and actually suggested that I should look for an older used Bose headset if I wanted.All and all - I'm tremendously disappointed.  I have nothing but praise for my ~5 hear old Bose headphones however in the past couple months, they intermittently disconnect from my Bluetooth devices and it's time to replace.",the United States,True,2,R3A7794HXBJ0MI,2025-09-20T15:02:39,

Mixed that with its comfortable build you could wear this for hours without a single issue.

To top it off, the audio port failed two months after obtaining it.I know Bose can do better simply because of the 35ii being an absolutely amazing pair of headphones before it.

IF you buy, do not buy black",2.0,Stan,2025-08-21,"After owning multiple Bose headsets over the past 30 years, I am SO disappointed in this product.First of all, do not buy black.  On black, the controls are difficult to find and the charging port disappears.  Any other color will do fine.  But, I recommend against buying this product.The instruction exist only electronically and they are very poorly written.The controls layout is, at best, confusing.  Additionally, the controls do not work well.  The volume control is especially poorly designed and clumsy to use.  The bluetooth connection is not user-friendly.  The on-off function is tied to whether or not you have the headset on your head!  It auto turns on when you put the headset on your head and makes  weird sound as it does so.  There are also numerous annoying messages announced in the headset - some of which are only sounds and you must interpret what the sound is in order to know what it is telling you.  Some of the sounds repeat ad infinitum.  When the message is a spoken voice, it is a female voice (difficult to hear and understand) and it speaks too rapidly.  I bought this set because my old Bose QC ear pads were getting worn and the audio cord connection had failed.  But, now I wish I had never bought this new headset.

They connect, then immediately drop the bluetooth connection (very maddening).  2. The battery somehow does not fully turn off so the battery dies (turning off your headphones shouldn't be this hard).  I've changed the settings to power down after an hour, and then I'll put them away until my next flight (<1 week) and they are dead.  So I am charging them all the time.  I've never had to do this with any of the previous versions.  I'm sorry Bose, but you owe the owners of these an apology and a refund.I've updated the app, I've updated the firmware... The QC Ultra are just garbage.I've contacted Bose and they immediately offered me a replacement pair.  My only concern is the Amazon return policy.

Great headphones but if you need support Good Luck!",5.0,Ron,2025-08-18,"My Bose QuietComfort headphones noise cancellation doesn't seem to be working properly. I called support which is handled by I assume India. Nobody could understand English and were just reading from printed instructions and not paying attention to what I was saying. They kept repeating the same thing that I had told them at least 4 times I had done After about 40 minutes on the second rep. he couldn't fix my issue.  I feel confident I can google my issue and most likely do the factory reset that he was trying to help me do. Unfortunately when support staff can't understand English every well and they keep reding instructions from their computer not listening to what I tell them I am doing. In summary nothing will change but third world support is difficult at best to help when you have an issue with your headphones.Whenever I used my Bose headphones I used them in ""Quiet"" mode which is the Noise cancellation mode.

You can't disable the ANC processing.",1.0,Robert Cherry,2025-08-09,"Awful. You can't disable the ANC. You can change the mode to allow outside noise in, which is still processing sound and playing it back in the headphones! There is no OFF functionality for all external noise processing. Totally absurd. There are many times I don't need ANC when passive filtering of closed-back headphones would be more than sufficient. There's also a weird hum if you lean up against a pillow or something while ANC is active... Again, if you could chose when to disable ANC this wouldn't be an issue. Let me be clear on this: yes, there's an app and you can decide (with a slider) between full ANC or off, which just oppositely increases ""transparent"" mode which essentially uses the built-in microphones to let you hear what's around you. In short, full ANC-off enables external sounds to play back in the headphones. Wtf is this? What? Lol. No ANC off and also no way to turn off the transparency audio? Lmao...$450. If you don't care about this and ALWAYS want noise canceling, then I guess they are fine.

It's been months it refuses to pair to my ipod. Sometimes it will right away pairr to my pc  sometimes it won't and I have to try multiple times to get it to pair and people will end up hearing my audio.There's a feature where if you take the headphones off the audio pauses. This is a nice feature. However they're also designed to pause when you move your head to a certain angle. This is a terrible feature. They pause when I turn my head or tilt to look at something else.Also when the I take the headphones off sometimes instead of pausing they will just unpair and power off and my pc's audio will start blaring loudly.

Technical issues after 2 weeks…",2.0,Charlotte Schultz,2025-07-24,"These headphones were great for the first two weeks of use. I wanted headphones that had good sound and noise cancelling, I originally tried the bowers and Wilkins Px7 s3s which had great sound but horrible noise cancelling. These had almost as good sound, and the best noise cancelling I’ve experienced. But, after about 2 weeks, the right side would buffer on the bass and then fully turn to white noise after about 5 mins of use and resetting the headphones would do nothing.

Ultra Happy With These Ultra Headphones. Give Bose Their Flowers Now",5.0,Mohican9,2025-07-22,"I own a multitude of flagship headphones, and I genuinely like them all. However, these Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are next level for me. The sound is energetic and clear. Bass on these headphones complement the music with a satisfying thump that keeps one wanting more. Volume is good. They do get loud. Bose QC Ultra headphones are not set to ‘library’ like another popular brand that I own.For controls, there are only two multitasking buttons on the right ear cup and a multi-function volume slider, but they are well made and function well. The earcups and headband are super comfortable. The comfort stands out when trying other brands for comparison. For example: I thought my Sennheiser Momentum 4 headphones were comfortable until I tried the Ultra’s.Recently, I watched a movie wearing my Bose QC Ultra headphones. The sound was so clear, and the headphones so comfortable, I forgot they were on my head and was trying to adjust the volume with my tv remote. Bose headphones always announce what device(s) you’re connected to at startup. That is a big plus for me.

For your own sanity...  Just go buy literally any other headphones",1.0,Amazon Customer,2025-07-14,"These headphones have got to be the worst Bose product I've ever purchased. So I'm writing this review about two years after purchasing it. I purchased it thinking this newer version is the better version, but that's absolutely not the case. The amount of connectivity issues you're going to have with this thing make it such a pain to use. It's never going to work or connect quickly when you need it to. The touch to control functions are terrible to use and it's not easy to get exactly what you want without sliding past what you intended for. And sometimes it just won't even power on when holding the button. This was possibly Bose worst design attempt at a product and I have the same sentiment when it comes to product quality and ease of use. The previous version they knocked out of the park. Perhaps I'll either go back to that or try a competitor now. And this is coming from someone who has primarily used Bose audio products religiously for the last 10 years.

Unable to get past the lack of usability",1.0,Yerky,2025-07-11,"They are comfortable due to the light weight and the plasticy materials they use. They do feel solid for the materials that are used. I have tried to use them for a few months now, but they have proven to be so difficult to use. Without the buttons they have had for years, something as simple as changing the volume proves to be bit of challenge. Unless perhaps you have the precision of a surgeon with your finger movements.Also, trying to switch between sources while having your headphones determine the priority of connection is annoying to say the least. If I am using my headphones paired to my computer and my phone, I will have to launch the app on my phone and disconnect which device I do not want to use, otherwise the headphones will switch to whatever device I do not wish to use.Now, I primarily only use my headphones for 2 reasons.1. Listening to music while working at my desk and switching to calls and teams’ meetings. I would not recommend these for that due to the previously mentioned challenges. You are on a Teams call and you phone rings. Your headphones will automatically switch to the phone. But if you are listening to music on your computer and your phone rings, they will refuse to connect to the phone so you can answer your call. And issues going the other way as well.2. When traveling, I use them to quiet the noise of either the airport or the airplane. I may also listen to music or watch videos on my tablet while flying. I cannot recommend these despite the decent noise cancelation. This is primarily due to the volume issue I mentioned earlier. Difficult to adjust to that sweet spot of drowning out the noise (ANC does not remove all noise), but still be clear and not TOO loud.This is only my 7th pair of Bose headphones over the years, but I am now searching for a better travel pair of headphones. For now, my heavy and a little too tight pair of Apple Max headphones are what I use in place of these new Bose headphones.

These never budged during my right knee replacement. I found them comfortable during my 2 hour surgery..The headset pairs quickly when I go between my iPhone and my iPad. It came in a nice zippered case and included the charger cord, a single 3.5mm audio cord, and a duel 3.5mm adapter. Someone mentioned in a review  they take a long time to charge, but mine are usually charged fully in less than 30 minutes when they are under 20% charged.",the United States,True,0,R2NDLKU1UZZ79Y,2025-09-20T16:08:37,

Best Noise-Canceling Headphones I’ve Owned",5.0,Kyle,2025-09-19,"I’ve tried a few different noise-canceling headphones, and the Bose QuietComfort truly stands out. The noise cancellation is incredible — it completely blocks out background noise on planes, in cafes, and even at home. The sound quality is crisp and balanced, with clear highs and deep, satisfying bass.The headphones are super comfortable, even during long listening sessions. The ear cushions are soft, and the headband doesn’t put too much pressure on your head. Battery life is excellent; I can go all day without needing a recharge.Pairing with devices is seamless, and the touch controls are intuitive. The only minor downside is that they feel a little bulky to carry around, but the included carrying case makes it easier.Overall, if you want premium sound and top-notch noise cancellation, these are worth every penny. Highly recommended!",the United States,True,0,RPZE390SSV6K4,2025-09-20T16:59:36,

Works well, sound is great, and my listeners on the other end of the phone say it's the clearest sound of anything else I've used (including other blue tooth devices and the phone itself).

Less than 6 months and they BROKE in two! This is Sony not an unknown brand",2.0,Mom,2025-09-19,"Purchased these headphones as a gift for my 18-year old grandson in April, 2025. They cost almost $100. I wanted to get a better quality set from a trusted name like Sony in hopes they would last longer and be more reliable.  It is September 19 and the headphones now broke in two. I know it is very late to return them but wanted to let Sony know how disappointed we are that a $100 item lasted less than 6 months for limited use.  I will not be purchasing Sony again and lose another $100. I would have been better off getting a cheap item and not losing so much money.Very disappointed.",the United States,True,0,RLJMX1YQML7RA,2025-09-21T12:11:14,

Sound profile is terrible",2.0,Ann Arky,2025-09-19,"I ordered the brown Studio Pro’s Beats. These are very aesthetically beautiful however, the sound profile is disappointing. The bass does not deliver as someone would expect from Beats. Too much mid and treble, and not enough bass. Overall sound is not loud enough for my liking. I also found no difference between the “transparency mode” and “noise cancellation mode”. In fact, my Solo 3’s that I’ve had for 7 years now sounds noticeably better than these brand new Studio Pro’s. I expected better performance of these Beats coming from Dre. Very disappointing!

Decent Headphones for Studying and the Gym, with a Minor Durability Issue",4.0,Daniel A,2025-09-19,"The Anker Soundcore 30s are a solid pair of headphones that offer a great audio experience for their price point. The sound quality is impressive, with a good balance of bass and clear highs that make listening to music, podcasts, and audiobooks a real pleasure. The battery life is also excellent, lasting through extended listening sessions without needing a recharge. I've found them particularly useful for both focused studying and for lifting sessions at the gym. They stay in place well and provide a great audio backdrop for whatever I'm doing.Comfort-wise, they are generally good for long-term use. The earcup design is comfortable, and the headphones are lightweight enough that they don't cause fatigue. However, I did encounter one significant durability issue: the lining in the ear muffs tore after a few months of use. While this was a disappointment, I was able to find and replace the earpads, and the headphones have been performing well ever since.Overall, the Anker Soundcore 30s are a fantastic value. They deliver on the core aspects of what makes a good pair of headphones—sound quality and battery life—and are very comfortable. The tear in the earcup lining was a notable flaw, but it's a fixable one. If you're looking for an affordable pair of headphones with great sound for both productive and active use, and are willing to potentially replace the earpads down the line, these are an excellent choice.",the United States,True,0,R17U3YWDX3MIUF,2025-09-21T17:11:39,

Top of the line in comfort and clarity",5.0,Kim,2025-09-21,"I have been using this brand and style of headphones for at least a decade.I am autistic and the noise canceling feature is medically necessary for me. I can’t deal with the noise level even in my home.I recently decided to upgrade to the Ultra model when the regular Quiet Comfort was experiencing dropped calls and, worse, disconnecting itself at random intervals.The Ultra model still experiences occasional dropped calls but it does not shut itself off while I’m wearing them and the dropped calls are few and far between.But the sound clarity is *chef’s kiss*. I’ve never had headphones of this clarity before. I almost feel guilty that I don’t sit and listen to music more often (I do sometimes).The battery life is great. They are very durable, my kids and I are always dropping them on the floor while they’re charging unfortunately.No issues with range but I mostly wear them around the house. I’ve had my phone in the living room and answered calls on the headphones in the back bedroom before though.I love that I can adjust the mode using the action button on the headphones.Also I can simultaneously have them connected to the TV and my phone without trouble. The standard QuietComfort model could not deal with that.They are, by far, the most comfortable “over ear” headphones out there. I have narrow ear canals and I can’t wear earbud style headphones comfortably. I have tried many, frankly cheaper, styles but have never found anything comparable in comfort. I don’t have a lot of money but I’ve learned my lesson, this is the only one I like.The Ultra model was well worth the upgrade.

Disappointingly shallow ear cups, but excellent ANC",3.0,Anthony H.,2025-09-20,"I'll preface this by saying that I tend to be very picky with headphone comfort. I am getting these to replace some Anker Soundcore Space Q45s, which work fine in general but have wimpy padding on the headband, causing pain after a while.I got these after a bunch of research, seeing that they were highly recommended by some reputable reviewers as good for airplane use. I travel via airplane for work approximately 3 out of every 4 weeks.However, as soon as I got them and tried them on, I could immediately feel that my ears hit the drivers, and after only wearing them for about an hour, I started feeling pain on my ears. I don't think I even have that huge of ears, but it was clearly not going to work.However, in just that hour or two of use, I was blown away by the quality of the noise canceling. In comparison to my old Soundcore headphones, it was like night and day. I can't speak for airplane noise, because I didn't even take them on a plane ride before realizing they were too uncomfortable for me, but they are much better at filtering out higher-frequency noise like voices.If you have small ears or don't mind the drivers hitting your ears, I think these would be excellent headphones.

I was coming from the JBL Over the Ear headphones, which sounded great, but even with having a smaller than normal head they would hurt my head from the pressure too quickly.

They'd be good if they were about half the price",2.0,ANDREW E TEDDER,2025-09-21,"Barely 8 months after buying these, the stitching on the material in the cups fell apart, and now my ears are being scratched by the bare foam.  The noise cancelling is sub par at best, if there is any semi-loud noise, like a fork hitting a table, the headphones counter that with a sharp, loud screech.  All the other NC headphones I've had have a much softer tone for that, but these are very jarring.  Battery life is great, until the stitching broke they were comfortable, but all in all, not worth it for the extremely short time I had them until they became too uncomfortable to wear.",the United States,True,0,R2OV1X9Y8S7329,2025-09-22T21:11:47,

A better relationship?",5.0,Gus,2025-09-20,"This product helped me better understand more of what my wife has experienced over the 25 years we have been together. The active noise cancelling works very well on these headphones - I talk to her while she is wearing them and she can't hear a word I'm saying - even with an increase of the volume of my voice. I can now appreciate the annoyance she has been dealing with for so long - I talk to her and she has no idea I was speaking, what I was saying, or she will just nod and pretend she did because my lips were moving. Most men have a natural noise cancelling that was given to them by nature at birth. My wife now knows what a burden active noise cancellation can have on a conversation - she might now understand me and my condition a little better. Since my experience - when she talks to me I pay more attention. Battery life, and sound quality is amazing. No connection issues, or drops.

The noise canceling is REALLY good, as is the sound quality. The noise canceling even blocks out my dog’s barking. I also like that the case is compact. The only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is because the call quality isn’t great. It is great from my end, in that the sound is crystal clear. However, the person on the other end has a difficult time understanding what is being said. I’ve been told by multiple people that it sounds like I am in a car, or far away, and that there is a slight electronic sounding echo. This doesn’t occur with my AirPods, only the Soundcore. That said, they are still really great. I use these everyday and only pull the AirPods out for calls. The battery life seems to last forever too.

Easily the best $30 earbuds you can buy, and probably one of the top 3 under $50.",5.0,Dysnomia,2025-09-21,"TL;DR Probably one of the top 3 earbuds you can possibly buy for under $50. Decent ANC, great features, great controls, good sound clarity, decent bass for everything but the very bass-heavy, stylish charging case that doubles as a stand, and they're comfortable.I did a lot of research before buying these. My $150 Status Between earbuds literally fell apart after less than 2 years. So I wasn't going to make the mistake of spending so much money if the build quality is no better than a cheap budget pair. My research into sound quality, ANC, app, and features led to this one being a top contender, and the lower price tag sold it. I am very impressed with their sound quality, which admittedly benefits from the EQ settings in the app, but which rivals more expensive earbuds. In order to benefit from all the functionality and control, you have to download the app, but it's very easy to use. The touch controls are customizable AND left-right independent. The ANC has multi-functionality, and while it isn't super strong (what can you expect from earbuds?) it's at least comparable to my $150 pair. Those who need really punchy bass will be disappointed, but by selecting EQ presets or customizing your own, bass-friendly users will still be able to get some pretty decent bass while balancing out more details on the other end. It doesn't muddy the sound. The clarity is actually impressive, things like guitars, cymbals, and snare drums really come through independently. Moral of this story is, don't spend more than $80 for even top-notch earbuds. They're all made in some Asian factory, they're all going to die sooner than you want, the differences between them are not worth a heavy price tag.The only thing I don't really like is that there is no manual on-off control. They turn off when you put them back in the case, and they turn on when you take them out. I guess it idiot-proofs them, but I'd rather be able to control them without needing the case. Also, the instruction manual is not great and even had an error. Thankfully, the app is really easy to figure out.",the United States,True,0,R2SRMSYGN1D6IO,2025-09-23T23:12:30,

I might be harping on that point a bit too much but they sound so much worse than nice wired headphones at the same pricepoint even like an hd598/599, of course i bought multiple sets of these for the utility they do have but I would have given another star for acceptable sound. again for voice calls etc they are fine",the United States,True,0,R1GMIJIE72JGK6,2025-09-23T23:12:30,

Review From a Producer/Audiophile",5.0,ljwojo,2025-09-22,"Keep in mind this is all taking into account price as well. Even then, this is still super good.Let’s start off with the EQ, the low end is a very good boost, I have it turned ALL the way up and it isn’t boxy or muddy, it might just be the way I set up the EQ around the low end, but it’s super good quality even after boosting the bass. I did the same with the Spotify EQ and now it’s double the bass…you can imagine how that goes 😛I boosted the high end a little and I just have no words, it’s super high quality for this price, I bought these at best buy and I looked up the same model, and surely, here they were.The noise canceling is really good if you think about it. Unless you’re at an airport and using transparent mode, you’ll barely be hearing any noise anyway, even without ANC. At least that’s my experience.These are super comfortable, over ear headphones, and there’s not much to say besides that. They’re comfortable lol.Not only is the battery life incredibly good, the charging literally takes an hour tops. It’s SUPER fast!!!Congrats soundcore, you get five stars from somebody who’s been doing audio/producing for around five years.",the United States,False,0,R2U049KSOLLYQC,2025-09-24T04:11:42,

Excellent audio for the price they have!",5.0,Jairo Boudewyn,2025-09-22,"The truth is that making the main decision to buy these headphones was more the price than anything else, I did not expect higher sound quality because all the ""in-ear"" versions of this brand sound terrible and those that have noise cancellation are null, so I ventured to buy them and I have taken a big surprise because they sound very well, bass good enough for some treble that also sound good, the good thing is that the cable is quite long, and that it brings an adapter for a larger plug, the only thing I can put buts is that it would be great that The ear pads were a little bigger and the pad that is supposed to be on the belt that holds the helmets is almost non-existent, it is not padded enough but for the price it is fine. The other reason I bought them is because I wanted to make a transition to analog because I'm listening to a lot of 7-inch 45 rpm discs and they're good for that. Don't doubt that the price is exceptional for the quality of these hearing aids. By the way, don't buy the Philips ""in-ear"", it's wasting your time and money, but these are great.",the United States,True,0,RWQKX999UM18,2025-09-24T04:11:42,

They Last",5.0,Cameron Herring,2025-09-22,"Okay so this review is a little late. I've had these headphones for about 4-5 years. I've used them heavily through that time. They've went pretty much everywhere with me. I've replaced the earpads, the head foam is worn down, and they're scuffed. All and all I love them. They've been my ride or die headphones. I've only recently thought about upgrading because of sound quality going down but its not enough for me to actually make the jump. If you plan on buying these for just some good headphones do it, these things are my babies. Can't say much for the ANC, if I don't wanna hear anything outside I just crank em up.All in all, some damn good headphones.",the United States,False,0,R2TG0QRT77H16D,2025-09-24T04:11:42,

Great performance for price but may not switch ON (even when it has charge) when you need it.",2.0,Shaan,2025-09-22,"For the price, it is an amazing ANC headphone and really cuts down noise well. However, very often, it would suddenly stop working. For instance, the power button would not work and the noise cancelling feature or to even connect to a BT compatible device would not even switch on. Then, you would wonder if it has run out of charge - and when you connect the charger to the headphone, and then switch it ON, you would see that it still has 80% remaining charge. So, after some hours of not using this headphone, it may suddenly stop switching ON unless you connect it again to a charger. Which is really annoying - as you would want your headphones to flawlessly work every time you want to use it (unless of course, it has run out of charge). BTW, it also holds charge for a long time.",the United States,True,0,RMVFN7IBGLSNZ,2025-09-24T09:11:23,

Unfortunately Disappointed",2.0,Taylor Hunley,2025-09-22,I really wanted to like these. I have a set of over ear headphones from soundcore that are great. Was very let down by the sound quality of these though. Even tweaking the settings on the app still did not help all that much really just made them louder. I know it’s a 30$ set of ear buds but I was expecting so much more. I have a set of 9$ earbuds from Tik Tok shop that blow these things out of the water. I’ll give it 2 stars JUST BECAUSE the noise cancellation is actually pretty good. Will be returning.,the United States,True,0,R1AFLZ05MC2FE7,2025-09-24T14:11:14,

I immediately bought some. Im pretty happy with the purchase. I like the cute light punk color and they do cancel all the gym noise in the background. My two complaints, I find myself maxing out the volume. I wish I went up higher. And they dont tighten? They basically come as is to fit the average head size and then you can pull the ears down to make it bigger but me and my son both barely fit it when it's at the smallest it could be.

Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones",1.0,Ironmoped,2025-09-23,"I bought Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. They lasted about 8 months and quit working. Bose sent me a replacement set with a new warranty of one year on the replacement. This replacement also quit working, this time an automatic lowering of volume and steady beeping in the headphones. I called Bose again. This time they told me the replacement warranty was only good for 90 days, contrary to what they told me when they sent the replacement. They offered me another replacement set for $239.00 dollars with, after some additional back and forth, an additional 20% discount on top of that. So, for $191.00 dollars, they would send a set of the same headphones (which I've have had problems with twice). I’m not an audiophile. I use these around the house, gym, etc. For the discounted price of Bose problematic headphones, I can 5 sets of cheaper headphones for their offered discounted replacement price! You get what you pay for? No! Not true. You get what they can convince you to buy with hyped marketing! Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice? Yeah, ain’t happening. Bose used to be known for quality and support. Not anymore. Your buying products that might be made in the same factory that cheaper alternatives are available from. If you’re an audiophile, Quiet Comfort headphones are not something you’re going to buy to fully appreciate what a devoted audiophile would be buying for discerning audio. For the rest of us mere mortals that just want a set to use at the gym and mowing the lawn, get cheaper alternatives. If they break, you can buy another set and you’re still way ahead in terms of savings.Buyer beware! Don’t recommend. The Bose name - yeah, not a thing!",the United States,True,0,RFFATUFNE6RE2,2025-09-25T10:10:27,

Not As Good As The Bose QuietComfort 35 II's",3.0,drew,2025-09-23,I compared the noise cancelling in these to my QC 35 II's and I could still hear my neighbor's bass with the new headphones. The QC 35 II's blocked the bass out completely. Also I've had problems with having to reconnect the bluetooth? Never had that problem with the QC 35 II's. Seems like Bose is joining the rest of the lot of manufacturers who come out with a great product and then let it degrade in quality over the years so your next purchase of a newer product will be a downgrade. Sad to see...I'll definitely be open to trying other brands next time.,the United States,False,0,R3GFUH22W3FZ1R,2025-09-25T10:10:27,

Quality headphones. A bit too snug on the head",4.0,SF1,2025-09-23,"Good quality headphones with strong battery life. I use these for work durinfg work from home days, primary for Teams video meetings. The audio is clear and the microphone has no issues. My only two cons are:1) The headphone is too tight on my head and hurts my ears eventually. The only way to counter this is by placing the headphones on the carrying case width wise. Over time (1 month) this has loosened the headphones a bit on my head, but I still experience pain/discomfort after one hour. Will update this review if I can get it to be fully comfortable.2) The headphones can feel warm on my ears at times.There may be trade-offs with every type of headphone device that’s not unreasonably expensive.

This is my second pair in two years",5.0,Darius P.,2025-09-23,"This is my second purchase of the OneOdio Pro C Headphones and I was honestly thinking of switching for a while but glad I didn't. The first pair lasted me about two years before I needed a replacement after one too many falls started to snap the hidden away band under the cushioning of the headpiece but, given that it still works even after handing it off to my sister and it was still wearable, I say it's still a really well-built product. As for audio quality, this still remains one of my best picks for sound quality. A little bit more on the bass side of things but you can hear the lows and the highs really well. The design of this red version is also really nice in person with really nice reds. Overall, I'd say that it would take a lot more to make me switch off these headphones as most consumer headphones are either too plasticky and feel easily breakable but this puts bang-for-your-buck to a whole new level especially for just your average consumer but adds a level of depth that I'm sure people who do some video editing and a bit of audio production like myself can appreciate.",the United States,True,0,R1B4LGQ0DUJWHL,2025-09-25T15:11:37,

Immersion mode makes it absolutely worth it!!",4.0,CityCitizen,2025-09-23,"Noise cancellation functionality is simply supreme, as is the immersion mode. I forget that I'm wearing headphones when in Immersion mode and just get lost in the high-caliber and clarity of the sound that is the hallmark of the Bose Corporation.They are relatively easy to use if you read the instructions, so, admittedly, not the most intuitive controls. I wish they still had the power switch that the QC 45s have. They have great functionality, and Immersion mode is particularly notable. I haven't had them long enough to speak to durability to a substantial extent, but they seem to be well-built.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the on-head detection can get glitchy. However, this is relatively easily remedied by recalibrating the headphones. I just turned the feature off because it was constantly pausing and unpausing the music when I was moving around.As to value for the money, I wouldn't waste the money on this version and would instead get the second generation (honestly, I'm annoyed about my purchase timing and the announcement of gen 2 a week later. Gen 2 is supposed to address some of the issues that I have noted). I suggest holding off until the price drops as a result of Gen 2's official release, as it is expected to be released at the same price point as the Gen 1 headphones ($429.99). If the price point doesn't change with the gen 2 release, then I recommend getting gen 2 in lieu of this one. If they do, then it's still worth it.",the United States,True,0,R3RBARVRHTEI3J,2025-09-25T20:12:03,

Best bang for buck on noise cancelling.",5.0,Ivan S.,2025-09-24,I bought these specifically for a 18 hr flight I had and remembered that my experience in a plane used to be insanely loud. So I didn't necessarily buy this to listen to music but more so to cancel noise from the plane. AND WOW I can tell you it silences like 90% of the noise. I would take them off mid flight and feel like i was getting bombarded from the plane noise. They are bulky but sooo worth it. I dont even use them for anything else. And I dont like earphones inside of my ear canal. So over the ear was a must. Would recommend/and would buy again.,the United States,True,0,R1CPVZ28NUZDSO,2025-09-26T08:11:30,

Four years later, a solid choice for this price bracket",5.0,Zachary N Rawlings,2025-09-24,"I've been using these headphones for the last four years, so this is the 'wear and tear' review.  TLDR: they're a good buy.  Don't depend on the microphone.  Life cycle is about four-five years before comfort items will wear out.Firstly, the positives.  These headphones make beautiful sound.  I've used them for everything from meetings where I need clear communication to hours of bass singers on youtube.  The range, the precision, the fidelity, all very good.The noise cancelling feature works well, and I particularly love the Transparency mode that allows me to still tell when my boss wants my attention while I'm jamming tunes.After three years of constant use, the battery life is still measured in days of continuous sound.  I can usually get three days (36 hours, I don't turn them off when I leave) with Transparency active in Bluetooth mode before I need to charge them.Now the negatives.  There are a few construction flaws that this model suffers from.  The material used to cover the foam on the earpieces is a kind of fake leather, and the seam is glued, not sewn, so after a year or two of use I found the adhesive would fail and the seam split, allowing the foam inside to make contact with my ears.  I fixed it by sewing it up myself, but it's still kind of annoying.  Also the fake leather is starting to disintegrate after three years of daily use.There is a feature of this model that allows the user to change Noise Cancelling modes by tapping the side of one earphone.  This appears to function by having some tiny bit inside that detects the tap and changes the mode.  I know this because it doesn't take very long before this tiny bit detaches and starts rattling around in there, and the 'tap' function stops working.  The first one of these I purchased, the tiny bit detached in such a manner that it would change modes every time I turned my head.  I contacted the manufacturer, and it was replaced under warranty, no questions asked.  (I still have that old one, as long as I don't turn it on and use a headphone cord with it, it still works great.)  My second one broke in about the same time frame, but the little doohicky inside fell down in a different manner so it doesn't bother me.  Honestly the 'tap' function is cool, but it's a gimmick I could do without, and have for the last three years.The microphone kinda sucks.  I don't use it.  Folks say it makes me sound like I'm underwater.Lastly there are some plastic bits where the headphone band meets the headband padding that break over time.  Again, it took years, but they've cracked and long-haired users can get strands caught in these crevices.  I still find it comfortable to wear, but I have short guy hair.To summarize, I recommend these headphones to anyone.  I have worn them continuously for four years in my office, and they have stood the test with a reasonable amount of wear and tear damage.  I have purchased them for my wife and my children, and that kid uses his headphones more than I do.  They are well suited to voice communication, gaming, and music.  My next purchase will probably be this brand, and probably without that stupid 'tap' function.",the United States,True,0,R3N1HZLVN1FM6G,2025-09-26T08:11:30,

I have them taped up with electric tape and they might be done for now. The keep cracking and snapping in random places even though I'm always very religious about keeping them in their case and don't treat them roughly at all. The plastic just seems to shatter eventually. I saw someone else walking by me once wearing the exact same headphones and theirs was all taped up too lol. So basically they are very good headphones but you have to treat them like glass. My sister has them in pink with no issues.

Pros:When they did work, they provided rich bass notes for both natural speaking and music. I never found the ear pads too cumbersome or bulky. I wasn't a fan of the noise canceling--but at least it wasnt supper agressive like some other brands.Cons:So...I dont often leave reviews, even if a product does not work but but I am beyond disappointed. I purchased these expensive headphones about 9 months ago. They sat in the box for 6 months (because I was getting ready to move). In the last 3 months, I have used them 6-10 times max and charged them 3-4 times. I have never work them until the battery completely discharged. Last night, I put the headphones on the charger and today they will not cut on. I have changed chargers, bricks, outlets, and the like. I have held the power button down for 15-seconds over twenty-two times. I have also held down the power and volume buttons at random intervals. Lastly, I have attempted to (re)charge the headphones for 1-2 hours to no avail. They still will not cut on.Reddit has the ""will not power on/will not charge"" as a common issue and I am working through the proposed solutions. I REALLY hate to say it, but perhaps I should've stuck with Apple products. (My SoundCores aren't that bad though, and they worked forever. They're bulky.)I really wanted these to work, especially since I like to walk. They've only been treated with the utmost care while they were in use and there is no reason for them not to charge or cut on. So much for Beats being on beat. Someone needs to speak with Engineering or Reliability about this product. 😞",the United States,True,0,R2WJ4NEJC4RIMS,2025-09-26T18:12:06,

U.S. warranty center will not stand behind them.",2.0,Stephen G. Council,2025-09-25,"First, I bought a pair of these off Amazon in 2019. They worked for three years. The left ear simply stopped one day while I was in Poland. My friend who has the same pair had the same issue. He told.me that he called the European warranty number and they asked him to send them back. He did. They called him after a week and offer him two options: 1. A replacement. 2. He could pay the difference ans upgrade.I decided to wait till I got home amd deal with the U.S. warranty center since i had a backup pair from anotherbrand. We both made original purchases the same year. The U.S. warranty center informed me that I had the option of purchasing a new pair from them at the retail price, or going back on Amazon and buy a pair...Basically, they offered me nothing. I bought another brand. I still have a bar taste in my mouth over it, but have tried to hold my tongue.  Now they are offering these on FoxNews through Amazon. I just had to sign on and warn everyone.  The sound of these is better than anything on the market. That is why I gave them any stars at all. Just know that if you buy them in the U.S. you will be left in the cold when/not if they break.",the United States,False,0,R1DBH2JZAC6ZMG,2025-09-26T18:12:06,

Good for listening but not for callers",4.0,Mary&,2025-09-25,"I've been using these for almost ten months. I originally bought them as a replacement for my daughter and decided to test them out to make sure they were good since they were not her usual school candy brand. They are an excellent substitute with the noise canceling being pretty much deffining and the sound is very clear and goes pretty loud. My daughter thinks the base is better on her original headphones , but she grew to love them as well. A couple of things I noticed is sometimes they will automatically connect and sometimes I have to manually connect them to my phone. This can get annoying if I just want to throw them on and start cooking or go to take a bath.Whatever it is I'm doing.I just wanna throw them on. The other thing I have been dealing with is anytime.I get a phone call.The person on the other end usually complains about the background noise.I'm getting.I've tried different settings but the settings.I think are designed for the listener, not the person.On the other end they can hear everything even the sound of the quiet ceiling fan sounds like popcorn popping or fireworks in the background. For me i'm not hearing anything but for them everything is amplified.  For that I took one star off because it can be disruptive during important conversations. I had the same issues with my Samsung earbuds and that's not fun to deal with. I guess they're not very voice isolating. They can hear me just fine but they can also hear everything else.",the United States,True,0,RQCFYUPJ9MGA4,2025-09-26T23:26:22,

Great headphones.",5.0,Mr.EasyCakes,2025-09-25,"These are pretty good headphones, for the price they are excellent. I would say the audio quality is 7/10 compared to really high end headphones, but as long as your aren't an audiophile these will probably be perfectly satisfying. I wanted these because i have been on the phone a lot and earbuds where starting to hurt my ears. These have active noise cancelling as well as awareness mode, where it uses the microphones to funnel in ambient sounds so you can hear what's going on around you. These features aren't perfect by any means though. The noise cancelling is decent and very noticeable. They will make life much more bearable if you're on an aircraft sitting by the wings, the engine noise will be far quieter, but still there. If the ambient noise is minute, they will totally be cancelled out. The awareness mode works, but I often wish i could control the volume of the piped in sounds, I often wish i could make them louder. It is noticeable that you can hear whats around you, but its not amazing. For example if you are listening to music, you'll want it very quiet if you want to be able to hear things around you in detail, like if you're at the airport and you want to clearly hear announcements. The ear cups are kind of small for over the ear headphones, but not uncomfortable. I would say they are just big enough for my ears. These are comfy to wear for extended periods of time and the battery life is lovely. Really spoiling if you are coming from earbuds that need to be recharged in the case. These claim a run time of about 36 - 40 hours. It seems accurate, I have run them for days without charging. Sound quality is good as I said, there are a couple built in EQ presets. Really you get no EQ, a little extra bass and a lot of extra bass. I prefer the little extra bass setting. Overall for the cost, these are a great value. I would purchase again.",the United States,True,0,R3SWEHCH4I44Z1,2025-09-26T23:26:22,

A solid set of cans, but keep weary of the hinges.",4.0,J.L.,2025-09-25,"Having used these cans for about 9ish months now, I can confirm that these things are excellent. The sound quality is pretty good, and the bluetooth connectivity has been pretty consistent. I also really love the design choice to include an AUX in port, as the battery will inevitably die at some point. On the topic of battery life, it's actually insane. When I first charged these headphones, I genuinely didnt have to use a charger on them for at least a week and a half. As for build quality and durability, the plastics are okay enough for the price point, but I do sometimes worry about the hinges in regards to durability, especially drops, hence the star being knocked off. I use these often when both gaming and working out, and have had absolutely no problems with them riding down my head. The ability to rotate the earcups inwards makes these very small for travel, which is a BIG plus.",the United States,True,0,R25DR7NGHDJIHZ,2025-09-27T09:10:28,

dont get anything else this is perfect, in fact buy two",5.0,Terry Seifman,2025-09-24,"Here’s a review of Skullcandy **wired headphones** (over-ear or on-ear style), focusing on durability (lasting 3+ years), excellent sound profile, and best bang for your buck under \$20:---I got a pair of Skullcandy wired headphones a little over three years ago, paid less than \$20, and they’re still going strong. For something so cheap, they’ve held up way better than I expected. The headband spring is still tight, the ear pads haven’t completely flattened (though they softened a bit), the hinges haven’t broken, and the cable jack still works in both ears. If you treat them right—don’t wrap the cord too tight, avoid yanking the plug, keep them clean—they can easily go beyond three years of regular use.Sound wise, they punch way above their price. The bass is warm and solid—not overpowering, but giving songs a fullness you don’t expect at this cost. Mids (vocals and guitars) are decent: you lose some polish compared to high-end models, but voices come through clear enough, even in busy tracks. The highs are honest—if not super crisp—but they add enough brightness that things don’t sound dull. They isolate reasonably well thanks to the ear pads; outside noise gets reduced a lot, so you can enjoy music or podcasts in noisy places.What makes them an excellent bang for the buck: durability + sound + price. For under \$20, you get decent build materials, components that don’t fail quickly, and a sound profile that’s fun and usable. You’re not getting luxury leather or Bluetooth, but you do get actual wired reliability, no batteries to die, and fewer parts to fail. Compared with ultra-cheap models I’ve tried, these Skullcandy headphones still sound better and last longer.If you want wired headphones that won’t break down after a few months, and still give you good sound quality without spending much, these Skullcandy wired headphones are a smart pick. Not perfect, but you get way more than you pay for.",the United States,True,0,R1FZDGVKIRG56H,2025-09-27T14:10:10,

2X Better than JBL!!",5.0,Ruzty1311,2025-09-23,"Ok, so initially I bought the JBL 720 BT due to price and brand. Got them because I was looking for some decent OVER THE EAR BT headphones (I have bigger than normal ears haha). This fit great, sounded good, BUT the #1 issue? They didn't go loud enough. They don't blast your ear drumbs. THESE ANKERS DO!! Not only do they get super loud (and handle it), but they are equally as bassy, and are even more plush than the JBLs! For $50 you absolutely cannot go wrong! Needless to say, the JBL's got returned and I'm keeping these! I'm telling you guys, you WILL NOT be disappointed! I haven't even got into the app and messing with settings yet but out of the box there's really no need. Also, the noise cancellation is SO much better than the JBL's lol!

Great headphones especially discounted",5.0,Patrick Harris,2025-09-25,"Purchased the XM4 and the XM5 to benchmark against an old pair of Plantronics BB2 that I've loved but are long in the tooth. My use case is primarily travel by airline as well as working out. I've always been concerned with using over ears while working out because they always seem to slip. So far these have been great, and the XM5s seemed to be good as well. The noise canceling seemed nearly equivalent across the two, which I benchmarked using a variety of different test noises. The sound quality for both was close, not discernible to my ears, however they are a bit flat in tone, which can be corrected using the equalizer in the Sony app. If you're used to very bass heavy headphones, these are not that and may disappoint. Overall, they are great headphones so far and at the current reduced price point are a great deal.",the United States,True,0,R6T86OM1MNGCN,2025-09-27T19:10:08,

I've only replaced the earpads once (with GVOEARS pads purchased here, of course) after about a year. I'd get another set of Q30s today if needed a new pair.

Great until they break",2.0,John Hoffman,2025-09-26,"I've been a long-time user of Sony's noise cancelling headphones. I think I've used the xm3, xm4, and these (xm5). In virtually all cases, they break after a few months at the hinge/pivot. This is actually my SECOND pair of the xm5, and this second pair has broken in the EXACT same place as the previous pair. Like the previous pair, I am able to superglue the cracked piece of plastic back together and get some more life out of them, but I bought this pair in January 2025, and it is now September 2025. Unfortunately, I know from experience I'm now on borrowed time with these. Frankly, they should last more than 9 months! And I know I'm not overly rough with them; I practically baby them, as if they were made of glass. For the price, they should last much longer. To put it in perspective, I have a pair of standard headphones from 15 YEARS ago that still work just fine, and were treated MUCH more roughly. I'm strongly inclined to not purchase any more Sony headphones, but I don't know if there is an obviously better option. If you're on the fence, I'd steer clear.Also, the software is buggy and will randomly turn on ""speak to chat"". I hate this feature, and I've only ever intentionally turned it on once, with the first pair of xm3, and them immediately turned it off when I realized it would trigger when I mumble to myself.

Cheaply Made, Overly Expensive",2.0,barry sandberg,2025-09-26,"Sound quality was ok, but could definitely get an equal sound quality from an ""off-brand"" (not mainstream) brand easily, for cheaper, and with more features.Main complaint is the material quality of the product. The design feels cheap and flimsy. I would not be surprised if these broke after only a few uses. The speakers from the inside of the headphones were covered only by a very thin mesh fabric. If you touched the material, you can feel the actual speaker inside the headphones.Overall disappointed in a name brand product that could be easily beaten by a cheaper, lesser known competitor.",the United States,True,0,R19VGDVWFT5SVT,2025-09-28T10:06:05,

Love that for a device I paid $370 for. Was told it was structurally too important so they couldn't give parts for, which doesn't make sense... Then it should be even more important to have it repairable! I'll be trying some sketchy Aliexpress repair parts if it worsens and will now be rocking tape...

Piece of junk headphones. Definitely not worth $350.",1.0,tredunlimited,2025-09-26,"I had the WH-1000XM3 for a long time, until one tired morning while getting gasoline after a busy night shift, I must have put it on top of the gas pump and left it there. I didn't want to spend $350 for the WH-1000XM5, but I chose it over the Bose because I knew the Sony will last.I was decently happy using the XM5 for about a year. I thought the quality was similar to the XM3 in sound quality and build. Sony ships these with a one year warranty, and it's unfortunate the issues and concerns didn't come to light a year after purchase.1) The biggest issue is that two or three times a day (with maybe one to six hours of use/day), the headphones suddenly loose power. The headphones normally create audible beeps for connecting and disconnecting bluetooth, as well as for powering up and down. When this sudden loss of power happens, all music stops, and it goes silent without any beeps. Tapping on the headphone to adjust the volume or fast forward does nothing. All things point to power being lost, as if the battery disconnected.There is a feature called ""Automatic Power Off"" that turns off the headphones when the headphones are removed, but even with this feature disabled, the power loss issue still happens.This didn't start until about nine months ago, so I've been hoping that some firmware update will fix the issue. It's a very frustrating issue, and this really makes me question about the quality of Sony products now. I feel like $350 headphones should have a warranty period longer than a year.2) The headphones start twisting on my head. Because of the way the swivels are designed, after a short while, the headphones start to twist around on my head. I tried my best to simulate how it looks on my head in the picture with the headphones on the pillow. The XM5 turns the ear cups toward the same side 90 degrees to make the headphones flat. I actually haven't ever used the case it came with, but this is how it fits in the case.In comparison, the XM3 ear cups also turn the same direction 90 degrees, but there's an extra swivel that allows one ear cup to be inside and the other outside. It's a bit hard to explain, so go to Sony's site and look for the photo. Maybe because of the design of the XM5 swivels is why it becomes crooked on the head after a while. It really doesn't affect function, but it just looks really silly.3) Not really an issue with the XM5, but have you ever tried the Apple AirPods Max? They are $250 more and for some reason, I find them unnecessarily heavy, but they produce sounds so much better than the XM5.I wish I could return these.",the United States,True,0,R37SY0GR0XPBRP,2025-09-29T03:10:00,

I was looking for some headphones to work out. So they need to be light and with some noise cancelling with decent sound quality. This products meet all those criteria.connection was very easy upon opening box. It has an app that makes easy to set sounds.Its very light. not too tight. The only issue us that ear covers are small, so it may be an issue for large ears. I do have large ears so it fits a little tight bot not too uncomfortable  since ear covers are cushioned.The material looks ok for the purpose.I tried the noise canceling and it does thenjob. I would say blocks 50 to 60% of noise. that is enough for me.In summary, these headphones are great for the price.",the United States,True,1,R190G7G3EY3IA3,2025-09-29T08:10:15,

Sadly, a miss",3.0,Christine Y.,2025-09-27,"Got these for PC with some Discord comms. Connectivity is so spotty that I can't use these for either purpose.I love Anker products but as a PC user primarily, their audio stuff is mostly a miss. I don't live on my phone, so I can't get the full features without using the dual connect so I can have the Soundcore app up all the time. To get Soundcore app on my PC, I have to install an Android emulator I've never heard of, and I don't use Android and never have.Too much friction with today's tech but it's the best I've been able to find. May keep these as a backup pair for my existing purse audio (also Anker).Otherwise, does fine for fit, though took about ten minutes of attempts to pair with my PC (Win 11, =( ). Audio quality isn't bad even without Soundcore but I'm not an audiophile so YMMV. The buds are too damned small for tap controls so I gave up on that quick.

My watermelon head is happy with these on.Not to mention the noise quality and cancellation is out of this world. The clarity is top notch. The battery life is actually insane, I can use these for almost two days straight (about 30 hours of battery life), and they charge in like 30 minutes. I don't even know how that's possible.

Great headphones for the price. Bad color",3.0,I hate walmart,2025-09-28,"Over I highly suggest you buy these. Fantastic noise cancellation. I don't get sick from using these like other anc headphones. Good fit even with my big head and larger ears. Solid sound quality with some simple adjustments that can be made via app. Which I'm glad it's optional unlike some headsets. Pretty coloration, but we will address that more later. Why 3 stars?1. No playback buttons like skip or go back just volume up, down, power (which is also pause) and change the noise cancelling mode.2. Noise cancellation never turns off. It drains the battery and can cause weird pressure for some people that are sensitive to it.3. The biggest issue, the color that is NOT the same as the image. The green is actually more blue. Robins egg indoor and more of a seafoam green outdoors. The hue is lovely. But the color is not green like the photo. A good way to visualize it would be looking at one of those paint cards that has different shades and names of paints. The photo is the one all the way to the right. But what you get is the left or second to the left. Its close, but not the same.

As someone with ADHD, they have really helped me not to get overstimulated. It’s easier to focus on my tasks this way. I have given it 4/5 stars because of the fit. When I buy an over the ear product I expect the product to go fully around or over my ears. This is a personal preference, i still think they are very soft and comfortable.

2 Years of EXTREMELY HEAVY Usage",4.0,Jacob L. Meyer,2025-09-28,"I wear headphones for essentially every waking moment; both for work and relaxation. I take them off to sleep and shower, but that's really about it. I EASILY have over 7000 hours on these headphones.With that context for the level of use, I've been wearing these headphones non-stop for two years. They still work just fine, and the battery is still very good. I can't say if they last the advertised 110 hours, but they definitely last a long time. I don't think I need to charge them more than once a week (even with my heavy usage). It's infrequent enough that it's basically an afterthought. There is a reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but I'll come back to that.The multi-point connection is a must-have for me, and these headphones handle that excellently. I keep them connected to my PC and my phone without issue. All you need to do is pause any audio on one device, and start it on the other. Alerts will still break through, though, so for example,  if you're watching a video on the PC and you're phone rings, you'll still be notified.I only just replaced these headphones for a simple reason... I wore the ear pads down so much that the vinyl covering of the ear pads started flaking off and getting all over my ears and neck. This also meant that the pads were no longer ""sealed"", and OMG they got insanely gross.The reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 is there is a connection problem that crops up every now and again, and has since they were new. The headphones will disconnect without a reason, and need to be turned off and back on again to reconnect. However, the issue is that they won't turn back on again for a few minutes. Holding the power button does nothing, and you just have to wait for about 10 minutes before they'll turn back on. I'd say that's really the only technical issue with these headphones.I'm no audiophile, so I can't give you an expert opinion on their sound quality, but for me the quality was totally fine. There isn't any popping, bass crackling, or blow out.All in all, I'd say they are a good value for the price point. You may not even run into the connection problem at all if you don't use them as heavily as I do. Additionally, if it were possible to just replace the ear pads, I would have just done that instead of retiring the headphones as a whole.I see no reason that these headphones wouldn't reliably last you for years under normal use.",the United States,True,0,R27R99UCFZA4VS,2025-09-30T09:10:20,

Love Anker products, but this one was a Turkey.",1.0,review by w,2025-09-28,"This is a review of the Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones.After 11 days of daily use (about 2.5 hours per day), the left speaker went dead. The right speaker still works, but at reduced volume. During the 11 days of use on a bus, I could hear rattling sounds and had the occasional connection loss when the bus hit a bump. Also, the battery life using noise cancellation was no where near 40 hours. As a guess, closer to 20 hours.Pros:Quality sound (for $30 ! )Noise cancellation works well (cut about 80% of the bus noise)Sturdy, well madeGood ergonomics, comfortable on ears.Cons:Failed after 11 daysPoor battery life with noise cancellationMade a rattling sound (loose components?)Temporary loss of connection when bumpedI have other Anker products that work well, but this one was a Turkey.

Otherwise, I have no complaints. the sound quality is nice enough that I am not returning them.  I don't need the noise canceling in public as the volume is loud enough to blast ppl out.  I just believe using a feature that makes my music sound like one of those early Discmans when on the move should take a few stars away in my rating.  I paid 20 or 30, I will just keep them.  if you are going to stay home with these and listen to music these are ok.  if you want to exercise at home with them, don't use Noice Canceling.",the United States,True,0,R2G9PG5ZZFSR2U,2025-09-30T14:10:29,

They've led to so many unprofessional and frustrating moments as I've tried to connect for video meetings etc.The sound and noise cancellation work well, but if I were to do it again I'd get another set of the 35s for almost half the price.

The ANC works well but there is a noticeable hissing sound but once you get used to it it’s not too noticeable. I work in a loud environment and it does a good job drowning out the noise. My biggest gripe is that the pleather pads make me sweat so they’re not the best for listing while being too active. I did see replacement pads on Amazon that are made of a different material that I might try out when these wear out.

Decent lil buds",5.0,Denali Gonzalez,2025-09-29,"I’ve owned several pairs of earbuds from the wired apple earbuds to skullcandy seshs and Indys. I’ve heard a lot of good things about these buds specifically, and decided to switch to soundcore after my Indy’s broke. My boyfriend got his own pair of soundcore liberty buds and expressed how much he liked them, though I didn’t want to spend more than 50 bucks on buds.At first I was going to get some skullcandy dime’s because of their size, but decided on the soundcore P30is because of their noise cancellation and general recommendation of the buds. I’ve had no connection issues whatsoever, in fact the buds entered pairing mode right out the case! They’re already paired to your device as soon as you take them out of the case, which makes it easy to use. The app has a lot of cool features to fiddle around with, which includes customizable buttons for volume and pausing and mode switching. These buds aren’t heavy at all either! I was thinking I could get a little pouch to carry them in my keychain since they’re light. They might be a tad bit bigger than your usual AirPods, if that helps, but they still fit in the palm of my hand.The sound is pretty clear! I haven’t tested out calls because I don’t really use buds to call, but I’m sure they’re not too bad. The sound from these buds aren’t that deep or complicated, but they’re not muddy. It’s on the clearer side. For 30 bucks these buds are the best out there! I would even recommend these in place of higher end buds if you want to save money.

Good sound overall...but best for smaller heads?",5.0,M.A.Johnson,2025-09-29,"I had a pair of Sony headphones which I always loved because of the great bass response. Oddly, one day at work the right channel failed, then the whole thing failed. Warranty well over with, my only option was to buy something new. With the premature Sony failure, I opted to not purchase them again, and reviews to Beats seemed positive. After a bit of studying technical details, I opted for these.When they arrived, all seemed well. But, right out of the box, I could easily tell the lower response just didn't match the Sony. But with a considerably lower cost, that's understandable. And within the first day I started getting used to the lesser bass response as I usually listen to talk radio and podcasts, so these worked fine.But...I couldn't wear them for more than an hour or two at best. These were so tight on my ears that my ears would hurt from the pressure. After a few days of this, I knew I couldn't keep wearing these for limited periods of time, then have to take them off again to let my ears stop hurting. So, I had to return them.Aside from my own 'big head', I guess, these would have been keepers. I was quickly contented with them, battery life seemed very good, well-made. Easily connected to my Android phone, as well as the Bluetooth on my computer at work.So if you have a 'big head', you may want to re-think these. Otherwise, they're a good choice.",the United States,True,0,RRDAHNM8EOC12,2025-09-30T19:10:27,

TL;DR: Sweat proof, good sound, dampens external noise, pillowy comfort",5.0,Doug,2025-09-29,"I love Zwift. Zealous new convert, yep. Tried the the H2O Audio RIPT Zwift headphone collaboration. Loved the colors, but I shorted out the left earpiece 42.5 minutes into their first ride, then did the same to the replacement pair in 52 minutes. Amazing customer service, but apparently my body repels that which is too fancy. So, got these, and:Pros:Cost less than my Sony WH1000X4 (or something like that) and my 3M noise blockers.Pillowy soft headband and ear cups. Become virtually invisible to me shortly after putting on. Similar feel to Sony (buttery soft) and fit nicely over my sensitive ears.Good sound. Dampens external noise (three fans, AC, Zwift cheering NPCs, wheezing & cursing), but I can still hear the phone ring when pizza delivery arrives.Sony has touch activated earpieces. Great, so I usually accidentally turn on a feature I don’t use or want just by repositioning them or stretching, or my cat’s warm beans do it for me. These headphones do not have that feature. Good news for those of us ham-fisting our way through the day. Buttons only, and they work just fine.3M changes my listening volume to an ear-bleed level when I pause or change movies/Fire stick apps. Even without full external noise muting. Ouch. These headphones just hold the volume I set and keep on going. Pause, change, it’s delightful.Pairs easily and quickly.3M yells at me in my ear when it’s on/off/about to shut off because who would still be watching a movie after two hours/muting. These headphones have a gentle announcer that also stays at a reasonable volume.The ear cups fold out which is nice since I hang them to dry them and the ear pieces don’t hide moist spots being curled into the headband.I like the white. It matches my Zwift Ride, just nice. Simple design.Honestly, no complaints. They’ve done wonderfully during 90 minute rides (I’m usually saturated in 20 minutes. Yeah, I love winter!)They look good, charge well, sound great, and leave neither sore spots (cauliflower ears anyone?) nor hot spots (my ear buds serve only to guide sweat into my ear canal).Cons:Don’t fit over/under my helmet for IRL biking.I’d like some color combos, like white headband with blue ear cups.

Bass Sucks! Where did it go?",1.0,P. Morris,2025-09-29,"How did these ever get the great ratings it has? The sound quality is good but not great for headphones in this price range. Plus, the bass is almost nonexistent! If you like a little bass in your music, pass up on these because you will be disappointed. I tried everything, as well as Googled everything on how to boost the bass, and also tried changing the sound profile in my music app’s settings on my iPhone. It did nothing for the bass whatsoever! I tried downloading several external apps that claim to boost bass, but nothing worked.  The Beats app wants to charge $25 a month for bass boost and that is absurd! I have no idea if that would even work with these headphones but for $350, they should NOT be charging to boost the bass and equalizer.I really wanted to like these but for the price point and lack of bass,  as well as the sound only being good versus great, these are sadly going back. I am really disappointed because previous beats versions have much better bass than these.Also, these aren’t very comfortable to wear after about a half hour.

They no longer turn on, charge, or respond to any reset attempts — they’re basically dead.For a premium brand like Beats, I expected much better durability. I’ve taken good care of them, never dropped or exposed them to water, and yet they suddenly quit working. Very disappointing experience for the price I paid.I’m hoping the seller or Beats support can help with a replacement or repair, but as of now, I can’t recommend these headphones based on reliability.",the United States,True,0,R1OLTKQBMZYKAC,2025-10-01T10:10:13,

Decent headphones which fall off if partially worn",3.0,Amazon Customer,2025-09-29,Great value for the price.  Performance is pretty good.My personal issues are the headphones must remain completely on/ over your ears or the headphones WILL fall off with the slightest head movement as the ear cups are pretty small.  This is an issue working in an office when you need 1 ear “open” to listen to others.  It is super annoying as they fall off my head numerous times a day.I also noticed I  sweat a lot more wearing these compared to my other over the ear headphones.Did not have the same issues with my high end headphones but admittedly they were over 6x the price.For a general day to day headphone they are a great choice.,the United States,True,0,R2CTBI90ELYNWN,2025-10-01T15:10:08,

Weird Constant Feedback",1.0,Thistime,2025-09-29,"Not very good. I bought these because I like over the ear headphones and listening to music for long drives. The first time I used them there was a pulsing sensation in one side of the headphones. I thought that it might be a break in situation because it did actually go away 3 days later. The call quality wasn’t that good either. One moment I came in clear, the next people would say that I sound far away. I still was willing to overlook the issue until last week I started getting some sort of feedback on the left side. It started getting worse over the week until any time I used them I was getting this am radio static sound. I might switch them out in hopes of a better experience but I hate the fact that any other headphones call quality is terrible if it isn’t an Apple product. I had some basic headphones that sound almost as good as these but you know Apple…",the United States,True,0,R197VAUKOFPZKP,2025-10-01T15:10:08,

They were good until they weren't. 1.5 years later they've reached their demise.",3.0,Chris F.,2025-09-30,"I only review stuff after they've been used for a while, so here's my take. I've had these headphones for 1 year and 6 months since April 1 2024, and it is now September 29th 2025. They are still comfortable, the padding is quite intact so nothing wrong there. They still hold a charge too.The micro USB is already updated (don't even buy these, just get USB-C ones at this point).My experience with these headphones were good until last month. I take these with me for 4 days out of the week to use them for 2.5 hours at the gym for the whole entire time I've had them. Mine get drenched in literal sweat which is crazy to say the least and I'm not sure if it led to they're demise but anyways, the issues I'm having since last month are Static in the Right side. It sounds like the noise cancelling is not working as promised anymore. I hear static noise sometimes whenever I have nothing playing through them and even when I do, it is still kind of audible to a lesser extent but regardless it is still there. The other more concerning issue is that they turn off by themselves rendering them unusable. It used to be random like last month but now it has been happening way too often and to make matters worse it has been happening in super close time intervals.For example, Let's say I'm connected for 1 minute. 15 seconds later my Anker Q20 headphones turn off by themselves. I turn them back on again, then they connect for a full 40 seconds before turning back off again. I try turning them on again and they are connected for a full mere 10 seconds before they shut down again. It is so random, and at this point it's time to just get new headphones but I won't be buying from Anker Again. Mind you this isn't even at the gym, where they're drenched in sweat. I also use them daily each night and sleep with them and the issue has happened more at night when I'm about to sleep than when I'm at the gym (thankfully) but I still wouldn't count them to make it past my entire 2 hour gym session anymore.Oh well, sorry to say but Anker used to live up to my expectations.

Read before you buy these Spotify branded Bose",1.0,Sarah Gleason,2025-09-30,"For this price I expected more.Product description is not joking... while they continually call it a shortcut button,  deep in the description it says you can start Spotify... literally only Spotify or Battery level.  ""Adjustable EQ puts you in control of tuning your music and Spotify Tap starts your listening session at the push of a button on the side of the over the ear headphones.""Wearing them on walks is miserable if there is any wind.You either get perfect noise canceling and you can't hear cars or all you hear is wind, its incapable of just filtering out wind noise and providing any kind of ""aware"" volume control. If you try to make your own profile, and enable ""Wind Block"" it immediately maxes ""Noise Cancelation"" and you lose your awareness in public.Customer service was awful. I got on the chat to ask if the shortcut button had plans to expand to other apps.  He first tried to convince me I just needed to factory reset the headphones. Then he told me I needed to reinstall the app (like that would magical add app features)... then he wrote, ""Also the purpose of the shortcut button is only for the spotify and Hear battery level"". This sentence written after trying to get the bot to connect me to a human for 8 minutes,  and after an additional 25 minutes of following his steps.The headphones are comfy.

Unbelievable value for an excellent product",5.0,D. Test,2025-09-30,"Don’t throw out the packaging because it can become your cover and case. If you razor off the fold on the box that has the little plastic handle on it, it’ll make an easy to open case and the cloth cover is decent. The headphones looks and design are great - don’t hesitate. If your head is small these may not stay on but the fit for me is perfect, not too tight and not too loose. The headphone cups twist inside which makes them easy to lay around. Noise reduction and sound quality sound great too.

The only thing I wasn't totally happy with is that I would like to be able to adjust the size of the band to make it a bit smaller. The actual ear piece is snug, but the band over the head is a bit too loose for my head.  Also, I have trouble wearing them for long periods of time without a break, just because they do fit snugly and it gets a bit hard on the ears.

Decent, would suggest, mine have a disappointing battery but that seems to be uncommon",4.0,"""dauthus""",2025-10-01,"Overall, I like the sound quality, comfort (fit), and would suggest these to someone who wants decent sound with a low budget.Oddity: I have only paired these with 1 device, a windows 10 computer, and sometimes they automatically connect when turned on and sometimes not, it's seemingly random.Con: The official specs claim that you get 60 hours of use, and many reviews (as I recall without rereading them now) have supported this or said that they get even more use time before needing to recharge. Unfortunately for me, the battery(ies) in mine are significantly weaker than that, only getting about 1/3-1/2 of the advertised time out of a charge (the battery in my ~2 year old cheapo headphones is still far stronger, like new, than in these - although, those cheapo headphones do not have the bass that these do). And again, most reviews I saw claimed they are getting more than the advertised time from a charge, so I would guess that you are unlikely to experience the same battery disappointment that I have.",the United States,True,0,R1838C2DLE3EWQ,2025-10-02T21:10:46,

My new favorite ANC headphones for VR gaming\movies",5.0,Kevin R.,2025-10-01,"Review for Soundcore Life Q30.Ok i'm finally making this review after several months.I love these things. I originally bought them for my gym sessions as earbuds never stay in my ears, but i could only get through half a workout before my ears got too hot and sweaty with these on, but that's not a negative at all.I always wear over the ear headphones and these fit great. The ear cups are nice and soft and seal well. Plenty of tension against the ears to seal and block outside noise (with ANC on). Has plenty of adjustment in the band to fir my small daughter's head and mine.With ANC on and equalizer in your music app adjusted properly, these things sound great. With no equalizer, they're mostly flat, but a bit muddled so an equalizer is a must.They connected through bluetooth very easily, no problem there.I began using them, over my old MPOW headphones, for my VR movies on my quest 3. The ANC is so much better than my MPOW where. Battery life is great and charging them to full only takes like 2-3hrs.",the United States,True,0,R2NLHWAHZ22U9M,2025-10-02T21:10:46,

Almost every single time I charge them -- and ensure they are clean and properly set and even disconnect the cable and reconnect it -- I will open them when they are ""done"" and one of the earbuds has not charged at all, leaving me with one at 100% and the other typically at 0%, so I have to charge the dead one separately.

Caution if primary use case is bicycle or motorcycle with open face helmet",2.0,Brett Phaneuf,2025-10-01,Sound quality is good but wind noise is surprisingly strong; they actually seem to amplify wind noise compared to no earbuds.

An increadible and affordable choice for earbuds",5.0,Eleni B.,2025-10-01,"Very easy to connect to devices, and the sounds quality is the same as more expensive earbuds. I was particularly amazed at the sound blocking ability of these earphones, as they can erase most low-pitched sounds effortlessly. One thing to keep in mind would be the fact you can hear the wind but personally that doesn't bother me one bit. Battery life is long so far (it's been 3 months) and I only charge them 2-3 per week.

Make it look Good but the cheapest things you can find.",3.0,James,2025-10-02,If you ware these headphones everyday they would fall apart in 6 months. Also the size is way off at its smallest it is still too big. I'm 5'8 weigh 180 lb My beats headphones fit just fine. But the raycon are kind of big at its smallest size. Apparently the Chinese think that we're all super huge over here. But I guess to them we are. When I use these the mow the grass bouncing around on the rider they want to move sometimes. The headband pad is the cheapest thing you've ever put your fingers on. The weight of the headphones alone will crush the foam inside the pad. Also they're over ear headphones just barely. With ear sizing they figure our ears are small. Absolutely no way to tell how much battery life you have left. And the instructions well they're in the normal Chinese fashion of really screwed up English. If the company who owns raycon is from the United States you need to get your head out of something and figure out how to make these correct. Now sound quality they're not bad noise cancellation not bad. But the locations for the mics Well they pick up wind noise. So you get to listen to wind noise because it regenerates it to cancel it out. I'm sure they know all about it. They just don't care enough to fix it. I have fixed it myself. But it cost me about $10 in different little pieces to make it work. Just remember these are not everyday headphones. They're not made well enough for every day. I would say they're $50 over priced 😁,the United States,True,0,R2OR4T8EJVO7AA,2025-10-03T17:10:44,

Gran sonido y batería confiable, con cancelación de ruido cumplidora",5.0,Camilo,2025-10-02,"Experiencia personal:Compré estos auriculares el año pasado y hasta hoy siguen funcionando muy bien. El pedido llegó dentro del tiempo establecido y en excelente estado. Desde el primer uso me gustó su diseño moderno y cómodo. Tras meses de uso en casa, en el trabajo y en la calle, puedo decir que la calidad de sonido y la cancelación activa de ruido cumplen con lo prometido.Puntos positivos:-El sonido es excelente: nítido y con buenos graves, ideal para música y películas.-La cancelación de ruido funciona de forma correcta y mejora bastante la experiencia en ambientes moderadamente ruidosos.-La batería cumple con lo prometido: largas horas de autonomía sin tener que cargar a cada rato.-Cómodos incluso en sesiones largas, con un ajuste que no molesta.Puntos a mejorar:-La cancelación de ruido podría ser más potente en entornos muy ruidosos como transporte público.-Las almohadillas, aunque cómodas, pueden calentarse un poco después de varias horas de uso continuo.Veredicto final:Después de un año de uso, sí volvería a comprarlos. Son ideales para quienes buscan excelente sonido y batería confiable sin pagar el precio de otras marcas más costosas. Perfectos para estudiar, trabajar o viajar. La cancelación cumple, aunque no es la mejor del mercado, pero el balance entre calidad y precio es realmente atractivo.",the United States,True,0,RWKERERUMVNGK,2025-10-03T22:10:41,

Upgrade from my Beats headphone!",5.0,Tawanda Barber,2025-10-02,I wasn’t sure what to expect. My previous Bluetooth headphones were Beats headphones after one year.

I called the number yesterday and today. Was on hold for awhile both times and then has me leave a voicemail, so I've left voicemail so far. Still no response. Paid for some crappy headphones and can't even get a hold of someone to use my warranty. I paid a separate cost for that warranty.

For my ears, I find the “acoustic” setting in the app to be the most widely acceptable for my musical taste. However, no matter which setting I use, I can’t seem to dial down the bass. I’ll probably need to make a custom curve at some point. They come with three sizes of tips which is nice. I use them at work for maybe an hour per day and I can’t remember the last time I charged the case. It’s been weeks. On calls, people say they can hear me just fine and I hear them just fine, but it also sounds like my fingers are in my ears. There’s this booming sound of my own voice in my ears when I talk.

My headphones remain aware of devices I’ve told them to forget, so I basically get three notices of connected devices, a battery update and they can barely listen to entire song before these headphones disconnect. Same goes for my PC. I used to love my earlier headphones, but these are awful. Headphones are supposed to transport you to another world with music.

Soundcore by Anker Space One – Review  ⭐ Rating: 4.3 / 5",4.0,Magda Nino,2025-10-03,"Noise Cancelling:The standout feature of the Space One is its Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) performance. The 2X Stronger Voice Reduction lives up to the claim, effectively lowering background chatter and ambient noise. While it may not reach the level of premium brands like Bose or Sony, it delivers impressive results for its price point—making it excellent for commuting, working in noisy environments, or focusing at home.Sound Quality:The headphones provide a well-balanced sound signature with clear mids and highs, along with punchy but not overpowering bass. They’re great for a wide range of genres, from podcasts and classical to pop and hip-hop.Comfort & Build:Lightweight with plush ear cushions, they can be worn for hours without discomfort. The adjustable headband fits securely, and the overall build feels sturdy and stylish.Battery Life:One of the best features—up to 40 hours of playtime with ANC on, and even longer without it. Fast charging also ensures you can get hours of playback from just a short charge.Controls & Features:Easy-to-use touch and button controls make adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and toggling ANC straightforward. The app integration adds customization options like EQ adjustments.Pros:Strong ANC with noticeable voice reduction.Comfortable, lightweight fit.Long battery life (up to 40 hours).Customizable sound via the Soundcore app.Great value compared to higher-end competitors.Cons:ANC is excellent for voices but doesn’t completely block very low-frequency sounds.Slightly bulkier design compared to slim models.Call quality is good but not exceptional in very noisy environments.Overall Impression:The Soundcore by Anker Space One headphones are an outstanding mid-range option. They offer powerful ANC, excellent comfort, and long-lasting battery life at a fraction of the price of premium brands.

The moment i turned them on I had my first issue. Mind you, I am a airpod and iphone user. I bought these because I lost my airpods pro 2’s. With that being said, these are not loud, these are not bass heavy, these do not turn off when you take them off your head, these do not switch between devices seamlessly etc. Luckily I bought these from Costco for $250, but even that is too much. I couldn’t have imagined paying $350 for these headphones. The beats by dre that I had back when i was in middle school sound better than these. Oh, and the noise-cancellation and “aware” mode is just atrocious (in comparison to the airpods pro 2). Not worth your money.",the United States,False,0,R12VH816HJQ76O,2025-10-05T09:10:23,

A truly impressive Audio Experience!",5.0,Amy Macs 757,2025-10-03,"​Sony WH-CH720N​I am absolutely thrilled and genuinely impressed with my new Sony WH-CH720N wireless headphones! Knowing I was buying a Sony product instilled a high level of confidence from the start, and these headphones have completely exceeded my expectations. They deliver the premium quality the brand is known for, but at an incredibly accessible price point.​The sound quality is nothing short of phenomenal. The audio is rich, vibrant, and remarkably well-balanced, providing a deeply immersive listening experience whether I'm enjoying complex classical scores, bass-heavy electronic tracks, or simply listening to a podcast. What takes the audio a step further is the brilliant ability to customize the equalizer settings directly on the companion app. Being able to fine-tune the acoustics to perfectly match my personal listening preference is a massive feature that truly makes a difference.​Beyond the magnificent sound, the Noise Cancellation (NC) feature is a real game-changer. It creates a serene bubble, effortlessly muting the distractions of the outside world—whether it's the chatter of a busy office, the low hum of an airplane, or street traffic. This powerful noise-blocking capability, combined with the stellar audio, allows me to fully immerse myself in the music.​If you are seeking headphones that blend top-tier sound performance, effective noise cancellation, and Sony's renowned quality, the WH-CH720N is an absolute must-buy.

Multipoint function and app support",5.0,RedMedic1972,2025-10-04,"I just got these today. After pairing and installing the app (Soundcore), I am duly impressed. I have 3 sets of IEM's with bluetooth amp/receivers, from relatively inexpensive to about 100 bucks for a set of IEM's. I have 4 sets of bluetooth ear buds. Again, from relatively inexpensive to about 150 bucks. I am picky, but also am mindful of the intended use of what I purchase. For being active outdoors, I like to get a less expensive product in case it is lost or damaged. However, I look for value for my hard earned money. For other times, I like to invest in a higher end product to enjoy a more engaging experience.That being said - these are almost as good as my more expensive ear buds. That they are multipoint and have app with EQ support is remarkable since they are not expensive. Easy to set up. I use aftermarket tips (Alenza or Spin Fit) so I get a bit more out of them than i do with the included ear tips. Size is comfortable. I am drawn to the 'button' style ear buds vs. the post style due to comfort and compact size, but - this is my second set of 'post/ style are buds - the post style tend to have more battery life. I really like the color selection - I got the green. Connectivity is a breeze - especially with the aforementioned multipoint connectivity. Seamless transition from device to device. All functions are at the tap of a finger, and they are user changeable. Volume range is fantastic. How durable are they? That remains to be seen, however these are well made and the case seems durable. Get the ear tip that suits you and they are comfortable for any ear.I am not paid to write reviews - I just share my experience to help others. I hope this helps you.

Great headphones! Just one flaw",4.0,Kelly Brouillard,2025-10-04,"Love the Bose QuietComfort headphones! This is my 2nd pair. Great sound. Truly noise cancelling. Comfortable. Long battery life. Comes with a case. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the wired option is horrible. It comes with a cable so that you can wire the headphones to a device with a headphone jack. I was glad for this option when I was on a long flight and the headphone battery did die. I thought I could just plug into my device with the cable and keep listening. Since I have Apple devices that no longer have a headphone port, I had to have adapters. But when I plug into my iPhone, the sound from the headphones is crackly with a constant clicking sound that I can never get to go away. The volume is also very poor when wired. On my iPad I turned the volume up as high as it can go, and I could barely hear any sound. All in all, I still highly recommend these headphones, as long as you plan to stay with Bluetooth connectivity and not need the wired option.",the United States,True,0,RLPJUJS3AOGI9,2025-10-06T10:10:17,

The top of My head is very sensitive so I had this worry about & the way these are made doesn't put the pressure at the crown of My head.  It has the volume controls on the wire so it is easy quite handy placement to increased or decrease volume plus can also mute it which is great when immediate shut down is needed.I have even fallen asleep wearing these & when I awoke I thought I was going to have very sore tender ears, be in A LOT of pain due to a certain medical situation....& I was delightfully surprised.....NOTHING happened...woohooooooo!!!!  I have done this several times & never woke up with regrets.  The earphones are very soft, not too soft...I would say....PERFECTly soft.These do adjust quite nicely....there is no hard pulling, struggling, functions as they should.  Price for such a nice set is even more the cherry on top of these delicious sounding speakers.Would I buy these again.....would I buy them for others....would I recommend these....WITHOUT HESITATION....!!!!!!!

Below average sound, no battery life, second purchase.",1.0,Samuel Mcginnis,2025-10-05,"Item claims 40-60 hours of playtime. In reality  it has 3 -4. ""stand-by"" time , a couple days and the headphone set is dead. Not as advertised. This is after two months of using them about 8 times. Allegedly, either Amazon or Soundcore ""refurbished"" them and put in a tired battery or the product's quality control is typical of $10 BT phones. Sound is what you would expect, or less,  for this price point...overly bassy, weak mids and the highs can't compete with engineering flaws as far as blend or balance. Still good for yardwork but don't expect to hear anything as good as a set of wired headphones for half the price. This is the second pair I had go bad. Out of frustration, I shot up the first pair with large caliber ordinance in a youtube video after doing time lapse on the the battery life of a whopping 6 hours at half volume with no sound cancelling. For phone calls, you are heard clearly, but there is all kinds of amplitude issues on your end...gets loud, soft, then constantly warbly/underwater sounding when you're trying to hear the person you talking to. I've had other products from Anker, every single one is solid except these. This product is either from a different division or farmed out to some snot factory and re-badged, or alledgedly refurbished and sold as new...two times in a row. I bought some weird name typical China BT phones and they outperform these in the categories of sound and battery life. Ugly as heck but they actually work and don't sound muddy, so in the next video I'll blow these up with tannerite after putting them on an Earthworks mic and comparing them to a set of 19 dollar phones, and doing a time lapse of the even crappier battery life. 40 to 60 hours...like a guy saying he 18"" and will last for 4 hours with Katy Perry of 15 years ago.

Sound and quality",3.0,Gene,2025-10-05,"I’ve had these Bose headphones for about a year and a half now so I feel I can give a fairly good update on them. Sound wise I found them to be pretty good. I tailor mine a little more with an equalizer, but they are nice in that regard. The adjustable head sizing build quality seems weak, as the adjustments can change easy. Nothing like the Sony MDR 7506 headphones I ‘ve had for ten years. But the biggest problem for me was the ear pads began to fall apart and I had to replace them. I felt these should have lasted a lot longer than they did. Of course, I use my headphones every day. The noise cancelling is nice and works extremely well.

Best budget headphones I've had to date",5.0,Ceirra Mitchell-Kyle,2025-10-07,"These headphones are simply AMAZING. Battery life is outstanding, sound quality is out of this world, and the active noise canceling really lives up to its name. I can't recommend these enough for anyone who has to endure long commutes, noisy neighbors in an apartment, or simply wants to block out outside noise on a flight. The bass might be a bit overwhelming depending on how sensitive your ears are, but I personally love it. Pairs perfectly with my Android 52 and I had no problem connecting it.

Outstanding Headphones",5.0,JB,2025-10-06,"I waited to review these as I wanted to take a couple of flights to test them out. They look great, love the slim case they come in, are marked R & L so you know which goes on which ear. A little bit confusing to get to operate as there are only 2 buttons to control several functions. You need to take the Bose tutorial online to get the best experience. There are 3 levels of quieting that you can easily switch to. I had another brand in the past, I could never tell how much charge was left, the Bose tells you when you first put them on and connect them. (Put them on, then connect them so you can hear the headphones tell you the charge % remaining).Now as to how good they sound, they are outstanding! On the quietest setting I could just faintly hear the PA announcements on the plane, the middle setting was also excellent and you could barely hear the PA. On any setting you need to make sure they seal around your ears because that is where outside sound can leak into your ear. Once fitted, they are comfortable for hours, (your experience may differ), they easily paired with my old IPad so I could watch some movies while flying to vacation. As to background air noise from outside the plane, I sat just behind the wing on one trip and in the middle of the rear on another. They were very quiet, you will still hear a little air noise, (white noise?), but not objectionable and after a little bit it was just that, background noise I did not conscientiously hear. The initial charge can go for over 20 hours I believe to you don't need to worry if they will last your whole trip or not. These are worth the price in my opinion.",the United States,True,0,R2IR93CL3C6FQO,2025-10-08T18:17:12,0.1724099099099099

I think Apple should’ve thought of that. People are gonna get sweaty when they were headphones. The sound is clear but it’s lacking the OG bass.

In my experience, they make good products are a tremendous value--often a fraction of competing products. The Q20 noise cancelling headphones continue this trend. After several months of use, the headphones have held up to almost daily use--battery life is excellent, the headphones show little to no wear, and the sound is tremendous. It doesn't have quite the range of the Bose or Beats competitors, but casual users like me won't notice--I only noticed because I compared the Soundcore to my wife's Bose headphones.The controls are simple and easy to use, and it pairs easily to my Mac, phone, and PC laptop. If I had any complaints, it's that the Soundcore app isn't as easy to use as it might be. Overall, I can't complain about anything major and I recommend them to all my friends.

Una experiencia sorprendentemente buena con los BEATS Studio Pro",4.0,Karla Ramos,2025-10-08,"Compré los BEATS Studio Pro color marrón sin muchas expectativas, pero me sorprendieron desde el primer uso. El diseño es elegante y minimalista, con un tono marrón que se ve mucho más premium de lo que imaginaba. Son ligeros y muy cómodos, incluso después de varias horas de uso continuo, algo que para mí es clave porque suelo trabajar escuchando música o podcasts durante el día.En cuanto al sonido, realmente me impresionaron. Los bajos son profundos sin opacar las voces y los agudos se mantienen nítidos. No soy audiófila profesional, pero puedo decir que la calidad de audio está al nivel de modelos mucho más caros. La conexión Bluetooth es estable y rápida, nunca tuve cortes ni retrasos.La batería también cumple: me dura fácilmente toda la jornada y carga rápido. Lo único que podría mejorar es el estuche, que aunque funcional, se siente incómodo sacar los audífonos. Pero por el precio y la calidad general, es un detalle menor.En resumen, si buscas audífonos con excelente sonido, buena autonomía y estilo, los BEATS Studio Pro son una gran opción.

BUY THESE!!!",5.0,brooke,2025-10-08,"YALL! These are fr the best headphones out there. I bought the new Beats recently and they do not compare at all….I don’t write reviews often but these deserve it. It’s October 2025 when I’m writing this - I bought these headphones late July 2025 and I charged them the day I got them just to have them all ready for my workouts, daily life, etc. I have not had to charge them ONCE since I got them!! Literally! Battery life is insane. Just charge them that first day you get them overnight or whatever. I use them daily, for hours at a time even. They’re also extremely comfortable. I run on the treadmill, outside too, and not once have I felt like they were about to fall off my head. They look nicer than a lot of the pricey headphones you can buy too. These are quality headphones and I highly recommend them to anyone on here looking for something new. If you’re out here debating these, TRUST ME, just buy them!! I can already tell they’ll last forever. Just such a high quality product I had to leave a review. Go get some you will not regret it!!",the United States,True,0,R3VE88AG2OKT88,2025-10-09T18:11:52,0.0818394886363636

Great BT headphones",5.0,Adam,2025-10-08,"Like a lot of people, I tend to only write reviews when I am particular impressed or disappointed in a product and I must say, I am impressed.Before buying these, I purchased and returned a set of airpod pro 2s and a $50 set of JBLs. Those headphones worked well but they just weren't comfortable and did not fit my ears, despite even trying them with the foam cover deals.These fit and work just as well as the airpods and quite a bit better than the JBLs that were nearly double the price.They connect easily to a variety of devices - my PC, my iphone, my apple tv. I can even have the iphone and my PC connected at the same time and switch seamlessly between the two of them.They have a transparent mode and a noise cancellation mode and a mode that is kinda in between the 2. The noise cancellation definitely makes a big difference. My lawnmower is extremely loud, and these make a big difference but I still wear a set of muffs over them just so I can keep the volume low as I have very sensitive ears. In my experience these seemed to work as well or nearly as well as the airpod pro 2.I haven't really pushed the battery life to the limit yet but I have used them for as much as 4 hours a day or so and just charge them each night and they have not yet went dead.They can be programmed through the app on your phone to control the volume, pause or switch tracks with a certain number of clicks on either the left or right bud. The case charges and is a nice size, pretty handy.Stop searching, these are the ones.",the United States,True,0,R2ZBD5YA5SWBTC,2025-10-10T10:16:37,0.1588461538461539

Really not worth it.",2.0,HimeMonster,2025-10-08,"First let’s start with the color. They are significantly less pink than the image shows. It’s duskier and can be mistaken for off-white. I was a little disappointed but, figured it was fine for a decent pair of headphones.But after using them for 4 months they randomly stopped charging and despite any type of online fixes and troubleshooting I tried they could not be fixed.I had to contact Apple Support who honestly gave me such a hard time until I emphasized that they were only 4 months old. Finally, they gave me a box to send them in for repairs (using my warranty) because Amazon would not replace them outside of the return window.They could not figure out the issue and sent me a new pair. I had my current pair for 6 more months until the right ear suddenly went out. I once again tried all the trouble shooting methods. But this time Apple support would not help due to it being out of warranty.Overall, the sound quality was good. I really liked them until I realized how much the music bled through. If I even had the sound up just below the recommended listening volume, people beside me on the train could hear my music. Charging was fast and easy and I loved the carrying case you got with the headphones.But for all of the problems I had with these? I would Not recommend them to anyone. And I will not purchase more Apple headphones.

A Tragic Love Story Between Man and Headphones",3.0,Michelle,2025-10-09,"Sigh. I didn’t want it to end this way. The Soundcore Q30s and I had something special. The sound was rich, the noise canceling was like a warm hug, and the price didn’t make me question my life choices. I even convinced my wife to get her own pair so we could silently ignore each other in style.Then came the heartbreak. One quiet evening, as I placed them gently on my head—crack. A sinister little pop near the right earcup. I hoped it was a fluke. It wasn’t. Within weeks, my beloved headphones dangled like a broken promise.My wife, ever generous, offered hers. “Surely,” I thought, “her pair will be different.” Spoiler: it wasn’t. The same cursed crack appeared, right on schedule. I’m currently in the “denial” stage of grief, watching them slowly self-destruct with every listen.The sound quality? Surprisingly decent. The durability? About as sturdy as a plastic greenhouse in a hurricane.I still love my Soundcore earbuds—they’ve stayed faithful. But as for the Q30s… I’ll be moving on.

I’m easily spooked so I love the option to be able to hear people talking to me.

Probably. But for this price, and compared to the $70 wired headphones I’ve settled, (and I mean settled with after tweaking the EQ of my media player; for too long and cranking the volume well past healthy limits) with using until I find the missing bud.

Good Hardware, Flawed Firmware",3.0,Eddie Mascari,2025-10-09,"These are great headphones, with some pretty significant drawbacks.For the good, they sound great and have absurdly long battery life, I've gone days without charging them and they haven't died once.As for the bad, the ANC. It turns on by default whenever you turn on the headphones, makes the audio quality slightly worse, and if you're not used to ANC it feels painful (which is not unique to these, just a problem with ANC in general). They are also prone to static clicks and screeches while listening to things, which can be at best jarring and at worst ear-piercing.There is an app for managing settings, sound profiles, and switching between ANC, standard, and passthrough without using one button to cycle through them, which isn't great that it needs that for full functionality but that's the case with a lot of bluetooth headphones.",the United States,True,0,R3B93MCP37IVGI,2025-10-11T06:16:57,0.1782894736842105

Do Not Buy",1.0,Emily,2025-10-09,"I have always loved my Bose QuietComfort Headphones. I decided over a year ago to upgrade to the Ultra because the new features sounded amazing. Instead, I received headphones that are worse for my needs in almost every single way.By far the worst feature is auto-off. I am a woman with long hair. Sometimes the headphones will slide over my hair and the sensor will decide I am no longer wearing them. I decided to turn off the auto-off feature. But even with that fature off, my headphones will power off for absolutely no reason at all while I am using them for noise suppression. There is no on-off switch I can set to ensure they will stay on when I want them on. Instead I will be trapped in a frustrating loop of my headphones shutting off and my physically having to turn them on.I will also say the on/off button is incredibly frustrating to use. You have to press it a certain length of time to turn the headphones on. If you press it too quickly after the headphones shutting off, it will not register. If you press it too long, you may accidentally turn on bluetooth pair mode. Sometimes your press is not registered at all, for no discernable reason and you will have to wait a half a minute to try and press it again. What I wouldn't give for a simple on/off switch!I am also frustated because I can not sync the headphones to the number of devices I would like to. During my work day I would like to sync to my personal laptop, my phone, and my work computer. However, I can only select two of the three. It's incredibly time consuming unsync/rescync the headphones so usually I am stuck using two of my devices throughout the day.There are so many ""quirks"" to these headphones that I don't think I can fully explore them in this review. Why do they automatically turn on when I unplug them from the charging cable? Why do they disconnect as my audio output every time I call someone, so I have to go in and manually select them as my audio output? Why do they automatically connect to my laptop, but I have to try to connect them multiple times to use them on my phone?The audio quality is nice. I will say that. But it is not worth it. I am saying farewell to these headphones today. I just want headphones that work when I want them to work!",the United States,True,0,R3AIIGT8RGSJR2,2025-10-11T06:16:57,0.0310918248418248

The sound is good for the price, the range is good for the price, I found that the band did not clamp my head enough.

The plastic frame on the right ear cracked at the headband and I had to fix it with superglue. Now, three months later after that, the earpiece started coming apart and there’s no way to fix that. Now it is just a blown out earpiece and the headphones are unusable.On sale these headphones are great, but if you’re looking for something, that’ll last, you a long time just save up the money and get a better brand or a better model. If someone is in a pinch, I would recommend these, but just know that after a year or two you will most likely have to replace them.I used these almost every day for a business and for the gym and for mowing the lawn.The app was really easy to use and the sound quality and noise.

Not even CLOSE to Sony...period!",1.0,mark mccaughan,2025-10-09,"Well, I really wanted to love them...I have an aging set of Sony 1000-XM3, and they are STILL twice as good as the Bose. Fit, Bose pinch the head/ears - really uncomfortable for any extended listening. Sony's are SO much more comfortable, especially after wearing the Bose for an hr., seriously - no even close. Sound, the all important ingredient. Again, not close. Sony is deeper, clearer, crisper, louder & MUCH better bass. Talk quality / Mic? Bose, even with ""aware"" mode on I talk twice as loud as i cant hear myself talk. Sony is so much more natural, call sound better - on BOTH ends. I bought the Bose ""open box"" as i didn't want out shell out 300 for 1000-xm5 or the 6 at 450$. However, i will never buy Bose again. NOT impressed at all.

Frustrating and persistent connectivity issues",1.0,hadriabeth,2025-10-09,"Unless you want to deal with frustrating connectivity issues DO NOT BUY THESE. While listening to music on spotify/youtube etc. there will be a crackle of static and then the sound cuts out, yet spotify/youtube keeps playing. If I pause the music and hit play again it will continue in the headphones. So the bluetooth is not actually disconnecting but the sound randomly cuts out. This happens often, several times an hour. I bought these nearly 2 years ago and have yet to find a solution. Turning off Multi-point connection does not help, as some have suggested on reddit. I have mine completely disconnected from the Bose app and connected to one device only and it still happens. Bose has yet to address this persistent and frustrating issue.This issue started months after my purchase so I couldn't return and have just been dealing with it.I'm a HUGE fan of Bose, however this has soured me to this brand.

Good Enough For Most Of Us",4.0,Chris Schroeder,2025-10-09,"I have owned a few speakers from Soundcore and even before they were known as Soundcore (Anker). The general gist of their brand holds true here: budget conscious products that try to strike a balance between very good and forgettable performance. The same is true for the Q45. These headphones are comfortable enough for a short plane ride but not so comfortable that you’d forget they’re on your head. The battery well above average in my experience but not 50 hours of continuous playback to minimize recharging. The sound quality is good but you aren’t going to experience that immersive soundscape that higher priced and performing headphones offer. They’re lower and punchy bass notes are muffled and sometimes distorted at the highest volumes and the high frequencies are there but don’t give you any shimmer or clear ring in playback.So they’re good, not great headphones.I appreciate a decent ANC option which does do a ln above average job of limiting exterior noise. The ambient mic does its job although I prefer slightly more surrounding environment input/level than what is offered. Compared to my Apple AirPod Pros V2, these lag in overall sound quality but offer more battery on board and perhaps a slightly improved noise cancelling feature. They’re fairly easy to use - nothing is unique or out of place for buttons and placement. And they work with everything I own because they’re typical Bluetooth so they will work with tablets, PCs, smartphones alike and not experience connectivity issues or non-compatible challenges. They’re sort of worth the money but only if you really are trying to watch your spending. I believe you can do better if you shopped around the $200-$250 price point.",the United States,True,0,R3I6KIQXJARQX1,2025-10-11T16:19:32,0.1832017543859649

They are so comfortable comma they are lightweight and the ear cups fit perfect i literally wear these for hours a day whether it's working or coming home and gaming. The sound quality is incredible, it feels like you are literally wrapped in the song or audio book. The noise canceling on them is insane.I often times don't even realize how loud Im talking. I'm currently using them as my office is going under renovations and I can't hear the majority of the construction going on, just one office over. They have pretty great range.I oftentimes walk away from my game room to go to the kitchen and I don't lose connection at all, the battery life is great I charge them maybe once every couple of days maybe once a week? But what really blew me away and made me come comment was the fact that I just realized i've had these for years literal YEARS with out any kind of drop in quality. i've dropped them and use them almost daily for several years, and they are still going strong. The only thing is that the ear cuffs wore down, so I ended up replacing them with some third party replacements which were super easy to install even if they aren't as comfy as the original material.

I am a true audiophile and sound with noise cancellation is important…if not everything when listening to music.

Verdict: Is It Still Worth It in 2025?",5.0,Victoria Marshall,2025-10-10,"Despite being a previous-gen model, the WH-1000XM4 remains one of the best value ANC headphones you can buy in 2025. If you can get them at a discount (which is often the case as newer models have come out), they offer excellent performance for the price.If you want slight improvements in microphone clarity, or more refined noise canceling, you might check out the XM5 or XM6 models.

I didn’t expect them to be as good as my ATH-M50s I at least expected them to equal my JBL tune buds. These are legitimately worse than my daughter’s school headphones that I paid a tenth of what these cost. All that being said they did have good active noise cancelling.I used them on the mower twice and they worked as well as any others I have had.They are also pretty light weight, unfortunately for Raycon I could care less about that, I would wear a bowling ball on my head if it sounded good.I also feel like the ear pads are a little small for me, they aren’t uncomfortable, just a bit too small for me.Another good quality I did like is they seem to be really well made, with a possible exception to the drivers, I really feel like the drivers in mine are blown and that’s what all the buzzing is from.

They are also extremely durable! I have dropped these things on asphalt, stepped on them, sat on them, slammed them in a car door, you name it. One of the headphones actually came off (my fault, I stepped on them one too many times), and y’know what? I straight up just put duct tape on them and they’re good as new. The quality has not diminished at all in the two years that I’ve had them. They’re not indestructible, but they know how to take a beating.In short, I am a huge fan of these headphones, and I highly recommend them.

Wanted to like them! But they fall short.",3.0,EJ,2025-10-11,"Audio inconsistent at different frequencies.First, I have multiple headphones and earbuds from assorted companies. This would have been my first Sony set of headphones.Listened to a demo in Best Buy of these and thought they were comparable to one of my favorite brands. Thought I would give them a try, but waited until they were a reasonable price.Since the demo is of select songs used by Sony, there was the chance the headphones would be not as good as they appeared, and that was indeed the case.After playing classical, classic rock, country and so on, I found there was an issue with muffled frequencies in the mid and higher frequencies in some songs but not others.This was both with using the Sony Connect software and without. Testing assorted options including EQ and various other categories.I could get some songs to sound better but it was inconsistent from song to song. But it cannot be blamed on the production of the song product. I base that on the other two major brands of headphones we have been using for years. The other brands do not sound hissy on some songs but not others. They are not compressed and muffled randomly within a song. The audio is consistent on the other brands.I enjoy playing an eclectic collection of misic and with these I would literally have to stop the song and play with the EQ to even make the rendition playable.I can give kudos to the ease of using the software.
