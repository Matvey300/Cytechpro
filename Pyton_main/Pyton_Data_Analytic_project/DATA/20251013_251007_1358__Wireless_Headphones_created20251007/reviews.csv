Cheap. Noise cancellation doesn‚Äôt work in",1.0,Jessica,2025-02-14,"When using these, all of the cool functionalities of Air Pod Maxes are thrown out the window. When replacing the pods, the headphones don‚Äôt sense when you have them on so it doesn‚Äôt auto connect to your device. You literally have to go into your settings and select the output to be your headphones or it‚Äôll just continue to play from the phone speaker. Also, since the sensors don‚Äôt sense that you have the headphones on, you are unable to use the noise cancellation function because the device needs to sense that it‚Äôs on your ears and it doesn‚Äôt. Sound quality is pretty mediocre as well, but I didn‚Äôt expect much due to the price comparatively (to apple replacements) and also, I expected noise cancellation to do more of the heavy lifting in that aspect.",the United States,True,1,R16TJQC87OJH3P,0.0083333333333333,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Sounds great, but you may need to reset AirPods",5.0,bongo,2025-02-03,Works very well. I initially simply hot swapped them but the sound was a little muffled. After placing the AirPods max back in the case I reconnected and the experience was much like the original cushions. So I recommend putting them back in the case after changing them out so the AirPods can recalibrate for a better listening experience. Note: if you need to reset the AirPods then press and hold the Digital Crown and the noise control button on the right AirPod simultaneously for several seconds until the light flashes amber and then white before you release.

Great Replacement Pads That Feel Just Like the Originals",5.0,Ryan,2025-01-09,"Apologies for how dirty my old pads look in the pictures.

Either way, they‚Äôre very comfortable, and I didn‚Äôt notice any change in sound quality.One small difference is that the mesh on these pads feels smoother than Apple‚Äôs version.

The best pair of headphones I've ever owned",5.0,Mike,2025-09-27,"I must preface this review with a note that this is my first headphones in this price range. I've been a longtime, amateur audiophile who's never had a chance to grab something this high-end. On that note, I must say these HD 505 are absolutely fantastic. I've used these nearly every day since February and I don't think I can go back to anything less.The HD 505s are a new model and I understand it to be an introductory one at that. If you're upgrading from a pair of sub $100 headphones, you'll surely be blown away by the quality of this pair. Everything about the HD 505 screams quality for me. The drivers provide a strong bass, crisp vocals and overall, a very balanced sound. From listening to to Muse's latest track or watching Andor, the 505s provided some lush and detailed audio.Now to speak on the 505's designs, these are super sleek in my opinion. Its definitely feels and wears like a upper-end model.  This is my daily pair and I wear them everyday for work. The padding and headband are super comfortable, causing no strain or irritation after 7 months of use. There hasn't been any wear in the material despite using them so often, which is something I appreciate.Now that I've took the dive into this realm of headphones, I don't think I can look back at using any cheaper set. Sennheiser has sold me on what they believe to be great audio design. The 505s are simply amazing and I couldn't recommend them enough.",the United States,False,0,R37KJC8Q5B05H5,0.2129370629370629,2025-10-07T14:14:00

A warm Bass and Clear, Natural, Balanced Mids/highs",5.0,Da1guy,2025-09-04,"I was skeptical because studio style headphones are a bit too bright and tinny in the high frequencies and NO bass.

It feels like you are sitting in with the band (play Miles Davis ""Kind of Blue""). I purchased other headphones like Beyerdynamic headphones, they were not the sound profile for me. I bought these to replace the Beyerdynamic are returning them. I'd buy these again, it was worth it. Amazon is telling me to write more details. So, i will add that they are incredibly comfortable and fit very well. I don't really care for earcups that touch my ear for long listening sessions. These are incredibly comfortable. A little warm but not bad. I purchased additional earpads that were cooler, so shop around. I hope you take a leap of faith and try them. You can always return them (thank you Amazon!).

a disappointment",2.0,George D. Scott,2025-07-19,"PROS- sound qualityCONS- no noise cancellation whatsoever, you can hear literally everything around you- very uncomfortable- low volume, you'll need a good headphone amp/DAC (+ $100-200)- not durable, they often break fairly quicklyI have been producing music for 15 years. I love music with a passion, I listen to it, make it and play video games. Good audio has always been apart of my life. I am a bose lover because of the DSP they have. Sennheiser, as we all know has a very neutral sound palette. And I really liked my HD 300 Pro Monitoring headphones for mixing and mastering tracks as they provided superior detail and spatial differentiation. The only problem with those headphones is that they are very flat and also the right driver breaks resulting in no sound on the right channel. I had two pairs and the same thing happened in both. A flaw with the design. I decided to try a different model. These 560 S headphones have superior bass and the spatial audio is great. There are some absolute fatal flaws for me though. The open back allows computer fan noise, ambient sounds and any background noise to be heard in full detail, completely ruining submersion. It's really annoying. I didn't take in to account the other reviews but it's a massive blunder. You can hear EVERYTHING. The other thing is that everyone is saying these headphones are comfortable. I completly disagree, they are quite uncomfortable. They are super tight on my head, causing pain and headaches. Way too much pressure. My last complaint is because of the fact that they are nearly $200 bucks and to really get the best quality of them you'll also need a DAC or headphone amp. So total you'll be paying $300-400. They are pretty quiet unless you crank your PC volume all the way to 60-70. I really wanted to like these but to be honest, i'm kind of disappointed. Finding a good pair of headphones is really tough. Especially ones that check all your boxes, as in comfort, sound quality, balanced bass and highs, durability, build quality, and positional audio. I also forsee the same right driver issue where it stops producing noise to happen on these headphones. I believe the flaw is in the adjustable headband. The wire for the right driver travels through it, and through repeated use and adjustment, the small cable can become damaged and eventually stop working. Overall, pretty pathetic.Lets talk about the only practical use I could see for these headphones. That would be if you live by yourself with NO ambient noise near you, as in not even a PC. Maybe studio use in the booth? The sound quality is good, I will not lie about that.",the United States,True,0,R1TSK0Y3BD75X6,0.1613110126205364,2025-10-07T14:14:00

2k-4k Ranges Are Too Loud For My Purposes.",3.0,Foxy,2025-06-11,"I am by no means professionally experienced in the world of audio, however I've had my fair share of headphones and know what I look for. Let me preface by saying these are not designed for listening to music recreationally, they are meant for clarity. The open back design has an open back that allows for this, and it aids in mixing. The directional audio is also superb, as it allows for precision in mixing and gaming. However, I must caveat this all. The 2k-4k ranges are very loud, causing tremendously crunchy/tinny audio for listening, and gaming. It may just be my ear, but whenever a sound in this range happens it is about 2x-3x louder than any other range. Meaning, if you hear a snare or clap, it is going to overpower any other audio range. I'd say it's not ideal when vocals are being overpowered. It's not what I was looking for, but maybe they'd be good for mixing female vocals. In addition to all this, Apart from the open backing, the body of the headphones are entirely composed of lightweight plastic. This makes me question the longevity of them. A common place to break on similar high-tension plastic headphones is the adjustable part of the band above the cups, which seem to lack reinforcement on these. Although, them being plastic paired with the high clamp strength does make them lightweight and comfortable.",the United States,True,1,R1BBXP7464MES9,0.1646969696969697,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Good bass, best headphones I've ever owned",5.0,J. Richardson,2025-03-26,"From the dawn of time, every headphones set ever made has faced the same challenge: how to faithfully reproduce bass so the listener can clearly hear the beat without overpowering the mids or vocals, which muddies the audio. Nearly every review I've read online complains about these headphones' lack of bass. Those reviews are wrong. There's plenty of bass in these *if you drive them with the right source*. Their impedance is 120 ohms, which is much higher than even the legendary Sony MDR-7506's 63 ohms. Thus, if your source has insufficient power (which probably includes most phones and many laptops) you won't hear much out of them. However, they sound just right on my desktop PC through my Creative Sound Blaster AE-7 PCIe sound card. They're the 1st headphones of any kind in over 20 years I haven't had to boost the bass on at the source. At the same time, vocals are crystal. In fact, I'd say these headphones have the best vocals and definitely the best combination of bass and vocals of any pair I've owned. They're also super light, which is great for long periods of listening. I've seen some reviews questioning durability, but if you're physically breaking headphones the problem is YOU, not the headphones. Build quality (fit and finish) are superb. The velour earpads are super comfortable, though I worry about them getting stinky and grimy over time from sweat and skin oil. I really think AirWeave would have been a better choice at this price point, but I've only ever seen that material used in aftermarket pads.I really struggle to think of any drawbacks with these, but here are some: there's no carrying case for the headphones and nowhere to put the 1/4 inch adapter when it's not attached to the cable. Both are odd omissions on a ~$200 product in this category. Some people might not appreciate the plasticky feel, but again headphones are supposed to be on your head, not in your hand, and everything that comes in contact with your head is plush. As these are open back headphones, sound isolation isn't guaranteed. Others will be able to hear your music (though it's not as loud as you might think), and you might be able to hear them (cranked to the max, it's likely you won't).I'd comfortably call these the best headphones at their price point and perhaps up to $300, as they easily trump my Audeze Maxwells. If you're on the fence, have an amp, receiver, or dedicated sound card, and don't mind their open back config, pull the trigger. You'll love them.",the United States,True,30,R1KTX9S5XTW887,0.2802785265049416,2025-10-07T14:14:00

A lot of times this will require extra gear like a headphone amplifier or a DAP (digital audio player).  These on the other hand are incredibly efficient.  I've been able to simply plug these into my laptop or my cell phone through a dongle and have no issues with lack of volume.On the sound side of things, they obviously benefit from any extra power you can provide.  Having an external DAC (digital-to-analogue converter) can help to clean up the source audio.  Compared to another Sennheiser headphone (6xx), these are on the cooler (brighter) side of things, meaning that the highs are more accentuated than the lowest frequencies.  If bass heavy music is what you listen to, these may not be for you.  In general, the sound is very clean and the soundstage, while not super wide, is more than acceptable.Outside of the excellent efficiency, the other thing that really makes these great headphones is comfortability.  Some of my more power hungry, planar magnetic headphones have limits to how long I can listen to them.  These, even in comparison to the 6xxs, are some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.  They are easily my lightest full-sized headphones weighing in at a little under 10oz (appx 0.6 pounds).  Unlike the clamp force of the 6xxs, which can cause fatigue, these provide perfect pressure, not clamping too hard, but also not being loose to the point where they'll shift around under head movement.Overall, I'd definitely recommend these to just about anyone looking for full sized headphones.  Sound is good, they are easy to power, they are comfortable for long listening sessions, and they look great.",the United States,False,2,R15MTPEYQWQNWT,0.2939573521716379,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Terrible Durability, Worse Customer Support",1.0,John Milam,2025-03-13,"I bought this item a year ago and have been pleased with it. However, right after the one year mark the audio started cutting in and out based on if I wiggled the cord around. Now the headset won't work at all unless I'm holding the cord a certain way. For such a nice headset I would expect it to last longer than one year. I use this only at my desk and don't move it, so it has been treated very gently. Very disappointed.Edit: I contacted their support since it was under warranty and they directed me to a website where I could buy a 50 dollar part to repair the item, and did not offer any other assistance.

They offer a significant improvement over any other headphones I've ever used.The sound is incredibly clear, with transparent tones and controlled bass that enhance every detail, whether I'm gaming, working, or simply listening to music. They're lightweight and designed for long sessions, making them super comfortable to wear all day without any strain. The 1.80 m cable is the perfect length, offering flexibility without being cumbersome, and the included drawstring bag is a thoughtful touch for storage and portability.These headphones have truly exceeded my expectations, becoming a daily essential for gaming on my computer.

Great balance between really good headphones and a fair price point",5.0,AZ123,2025-02-27,"These HD 505 headphones by Sennheiser sound really good, with great clarity, definition, and frequency range. I think some people might find them a bit uncolorful, since they reproduce sounds faithfully and without added bass or high frequency 'enhancement', but I like the sound quality a lot. One nice thing is that I'm far less reliant on a separate headphone amp with these cans; while an amp does help a bit (I tried a moderately priced Fiio), I thought the Sennheisers sounded about as good on their own.I've always liked Sennheisers; I was one of the millions that had a pair of HD 414s back in the day, and more recently have enjoyed earbuds from the company. The HD 505s continue the tradition of having good quality products at a fair price; I think most people without golden ears (i.e., most people, period) would experience these phones as being very, very good. I've had limited experience with the company's higher-end headphones, which are great, but I just can't see paying the higher price for them when thse 505s are this good. They're also pretty lightweight and very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods, which is greatly appreciated. I also liked the nicely long (1.8m) cable, which also includes the larger jack for hifi equipment.I think that, nowadays, that good headphones might be an endangered species, with smart speakers, earbuds, and the like making 'good enough' okay for most people. If you're going to consider having a good experience with what at least used to be called critical listening, though, these Sennheiser headphones are a good place to start, given their price point and overall good quality.

The good ole Sennheiser days return",5.0,Johnny,2025-02-25,"Back in my youth, the must have and then revolutionary headphone was the Sennhiser HD 424.

The Sennheisers were instead light as air and were the only thing I requested for graduation . . . way way back.This just released HD 505 model pays tribute to the famous classic and is, of course, greatly improved after 40 some years.

""stand-by"" time , a couple days and the headphone set is dead. Not as advertised. This is after two months of using them about 8 times. Allegedly, either Amazon or Soundcore ""refurbished"" them and put in a tired battery or the product's quality control is typical of $10 BT phones. Sound is what you would expect, or less,  for this price point...overly bassy, weak mids and the highs can't compete with engineering flaws as far as blend or balance. Still good for yardwork but don't expect to hear anything as good as a set of wired headphones for half the price. This is the second pair I had go bad. Out of frustration, I shot up the first pair with large caliber ordinance in a youtube video after doing time lapse on the the battery life of a whopping 6 hours at half volume with no sound cancelling. For phone calls, you are heard clearly, but there is all kinds of amplitude issues on your end...gets loud, soft, then constantly warbly/underwater sounding when you're trying to hear the person you talking to. I've had other products from Anker, every single one is solid except these. This product is either from a different division or farmed out to some snot factory and re-badged, or alledgedly refurbished and sold as new...two times in a row. I bought some weird name typical China BT phones and they outperform these in the categories of sound and battery life. Ugly as heck but they actually work and don't sound muddy, so in the next video I'll blow these up with tannerite after putting them on an Earthworks mic and comparing them to a set of 19 dollar phones, and doing a time lapse of the even crappier battery life. 40 to 60 hours...like a guy saying he 18"" and will last for 4 hours with Katy Perry of 15 years ago.

Decent, would suggest, mine have a disappointing battery but that seems to be uncommon",4.0,"""dauthus""",2025-10-01,"Overall, I like the sound quality, comfort (fit), and would suggest these to someone who wants decent sound with a low budget.Oddity: I have only paired these with 1 device, a windows 10 computer, and sometimes they automatically connect when turned on and sometimes not, it's seemingly random.Con: The official specs claim that you get 60 hours of use, and many reviews (as I recall without rereading them now) have supported this or said that they get even more use time before needing to recharge. Unfortunately for me, the battery(ies) in mine are significantly weaker than that, only getting about 1/3-1/2 of the advertised time out of a charge (the battery in my ~2 year old cheapo headphones is still far stronger, like new, than in these - although, those cheapo headphones do not have the bass that these do).

They were good until they weren't. 1.5 years later they've reached their demise.",3.0,Chris F.,2025-09-30,"I only review stuff after they've been used for a while, so here's my take. I've had these headphones for 1 year and 6 months since April 1 2024, and it is now September 29th 2025. They are still comfortable, the padding is quite intact so nothing wrong there. They still hold a charge too.The micro USB is already updated (don't even buy these, just get USB-C ones at this point).My experience with these headphones were good until last month. I take these with me for 4 days out of the week to use them for 2.5 hours at the gym for the whole entire time I've had them. Mine get drenched in literal sweat which is crazy to say the least and I'm not sure if it led to they're demise but anyways, the issues I'm having since last month are Static in the Right side. It sounds like the noise cancelling is not working as promised anymore. I hear static noise sometimes whenever I have nothing playing through them and even when I do, it is still kind of audible to a lesser extent but regardless it is still there. The other more concerning issue is that they turn off by themselves rendering them unusable. It used to be random like last month but now it has been happening way too often and to make matters worse it has been happening in super close time intervals.For example, Let's say I'm connected for 1 minute. 15 seconds later my Anker Q20 headphones turn off by themselves. I turn them back on again, then they connect for a full 40 seconds before turning back off again. I try turning them on again and they are connected for a full mere 10 seconds before they shut down again. It is so random, and at this point it's time to just get new headphones but I won't be buying from Anker Again. Mind you this isn't even at the gym, where they're drenched in sweat. I also use them daily each night and sleep with them and the issue has happened more at night when I'm about to sleep than when I'm at the gym (thankfully) but I still wouldn't count them to make it past my entire 2 hour gym session anymore.Oh well, sorry to say but Anker used to live up to my expectations.

Love Anker products, but this one was a Turkey.",1.0,review by w,2025-09-28,"This is a review of the Soundcore Anker Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones.After 11 days of daily use (about 2.5 hours per day), the left speaker went dead. The right speaker still works, but at reduced volume. During the 11 days of use on a bus, I could hear rattling sounds and had the occasional connection loss when the bus hit a bump. Also, the battery life using noise cancellation was no where near 40 hours. As a guess, closer to 20 hours.Pros:Quality sound (for $30 ! )Noise cancellation works well (cut about 80% of the bus noise)Sturdy, well madeGood ergonomics, comfortable on ears.Cons:Failed after 11 daysPoor battery life with noise cancellationMade a rattling sound (loose components?)Temporary loss of connection when bumpedI have other Anker products that work well, but this one was a Turkey.

Otherwise, I have no complaints. the sound quality is nice enough that I am not returning them.  I don't need the noise canceling in public as the volume is loud enough to blast ppl out.  I just believe using a feature that makes my music sound like one of those early Discmans when on the move should take a few stars away in my rating.  I paid 20 or 30, I will just keep them.  if you are going to stay home with these and listen to music these are ok.  if you want to exercise at home with them, don't use Noice Canceling.",the United States,True,1,R2G9PG5ZZFSR2U,0.2121212121212121,2025-10-07T14:14:00

I heard that!",4.0,David Ramsey,2025-09-09,"These are very comfortable and audible headphones. The noise-canceling feature works well when I am walking along a city street or when a leaf blower is being used nearby.My only complaint is that they don't fit under the hat I always wear when walking outside. The 'over the top of the head' band will rest on the collar of my shirt and then only an occasional push is required to keep the earpieces in place, but it's a little annoying.

Everything but durability is great.",3.0,Farah,2025-06-26,"The quality of the headphones itself is great, the battery lasts A WHILE, its easy to use, and connectivity and sound quality are GREAT!! I've never had any issues with either. However, it isn't exactly the most durable. I've bought about three of these in three years, so it seems that if you're someone who'se going to use these in the gym or need to use them often for long hours they will probably break sooner than later.

Great bluetooth wireless headphones for tv, movies or the phone!",5.0,tarra byte,2025-04-27,"I added a bluetooth receiver to my older television and wanted headphones I could use while watching TV. My hearing is wrecked from all that loud rock n roll so wearing headphones while watching tv or movies has become a necessity. The way movies and tv sound goes from a whisper to loud, to crashing, to a whisper. My ears just can't decipher it all. But with the headphones I can hear everything, and I can get up and grab a snack without wires. This solution is working well and bonus, you can also use it with your phone if you pair it. Sources say, the sound was fine. Battery life is very good, meaning I charge for a couple hours every day, but I haven't run out of battery while talking on the phone or watching tv.  The controls are small but you learn what's what. I could see Sasquatch maybe having trouble with the small controls, but I think most humans can use them with a little practice.  I paired these headphones with a wireless bluetooth receiver I got for my television since it doesn't have built in bluetooth. The headphones are comfortable, light and fit well. They don't slide down after a while, they stay put. Very happy for the overall usefulness and quality for the value.",the United States,True,15,R1TIJDQXT8AV61,0.2305709876543209,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Excellent audio for the price they have!",5.0,Jairo Boudewyn,2025-09-22,"The truth is that making the main decision to buy these headphones was more the price than anything else, I did not expect higher sound quality because all the ""in-ear"" versions of this brand sound terrible and those that have noise cancellation are null, so I ventured to buy them and I have taken a big surprise because they sound very well, bass good enough for some treble that also sound good, the good thing is that the cable is quite long, and that it brings an adapter for a larger plug, the only thing I can put buts is that it would be great that The ear pads were a little bigger and the pad that is supposed to be on the belt that holds the helmets is almost non-existent, it is not padded enough but for the price it is fine. The other reason I bought them is because I wanted to make a transition to analog because I'm listening to a lot of 7-inch 45 rpm discs and they're good for that. Don't doubt that the price is exceptional for the quality of these hearing aids.

The cord is waaaaaay longer than I ever expected!",4.0,Mom1,2025-09-13,"I bought the silver headphones. I just wanted some headphones so I could listen to my records and not wake up the whole house. When I first took them out, I liked they way they looked and Philips is a well known brand. I also liked the fact that I could connect the headphones with two different jacks. What I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was the extremely long cord!! I‚Äôve never owned headphones like this. I can walk to another bedroom and not tug on the cord. I took a close look at the box and it says TV listening 6m. That‚Äôs 6 meters! I didn‚Äôt want TV headphones, but that‚Äôs what I was sent. I looked back on the product page and the video even says 2m. That would have been better. I guess in the bright side is that I can walk around my office room and have enough cord to walk around. The sound quality is decent. Wish it had more bass, but it could just be the record player. I do like the feel of the fabric ear pads and the volume control wheel on the cord itself.

Great sound and more pronounced bass",5.0,Carolyn M.,2025-08-30,"I purchased these just to listen to music on my cell phone and Sony Walkman, so no professional.  I bought this set and Rumoon headphones https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D14FBD59?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1My comparison of the two:This set sits more comfortable on my head, but I did find I felt a bit of a squeeze just under my ear, although they felt great On my ear, and overall, after moving them around the squeeze wasn't enough to deter me away from them.The sound is very good on these, way better than the AKG earbuds I tried to use, (which were horribly tinny and would not fit right in my ears).  There were a couple of songs where it was a little 'crackly' in my ears, but both these and the Rumoon did it to be honest.  The volume is definitely lower on these than on the Rumoon.  I don't like exceptionally loud noises anyway, so with the headphones all the way up and my phone volume all the way up, it was still comfortably loud.  It would probably be too low for a lot of people.  It is a nice feature that the cord is Really long, like super long, and there's volume control right on the cord.It was a really hard decision for me which set to go with, but ultimately, I prefer the bass being a bit more pronounced, which makes the music feel more immersive to me.",the United States,True,1,R1BXT3UNYR64C6,0.1726998299319728,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Very uncomfortable",2.0,Carter S,2025-06-08,"These are listed as over ear headphones. One would expect them to completely cover your ears. However, the ear cups are very small, so my earlobes poke out the bottom. The tilt of the earcups cannot be adjusted, and as such, they leave a big gap at the back of my ears. Usually the top of my outer ears won‚Äôt fit inside either. This makes them more like on-ear headphones, they are very uncomfortable.I have a big head, but that shouldn‚Äôt matter.The way these are designed, the earcups are very easy to pull off, and hard to put back on. I initially thought you had to jam it back into the tiny gap they attach through. I was wrong!You can actually CAREFULLY pry out the part holding the speaker. It‚Äôs just got some clips then it pops out. You can then stretch the earcup back over the plastic piece, seat it on some pegs, and snap the whole thing back into place.Do be careful, the wires that attach to the speaker driver are thin and could break off.Onto the positives: They‚Äôre a good price if the aforementioned flaws were fixed. I‚Äôm almost tempted to glue different ear cups onto these.The sound quality of these is pretty good! They‚Äôve got a lot more highs compared to my previous headphones which I now realize sound muddy in comparison.The cord is very long, longer than I need it to be, so I wrapped up the excess with rubber bands.The headband has very minimal padding, but that‚Äôs not really an issue, as the support comes from the ear pads, not the top of the head.They do not fold or swivel in any way, which is a downside for fit, comfort and portability. However, they are tilted, which is nice.",the United States,False,0,RLTXJW6NJH9EP,0.1348717948717948,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Sadly, foam earpiece covers come off with slightest touch, rendering headphones useless!",1.0,Allan F. Eddy,2025-05-17,"I originally wrote a favorable review for these headphones; however, as my wife was packing a suitcase, she asked me, ""What is this piece of foam?"" Unfortunately, I didn't know what the foam was that she was asking about, so I told her to just throw it away...oops...mistake! On later examination I found it to be one of the foam earpiece covers, and I discovered both earpiece foam pieces were so susceptible to coming off that a simple bump of any type would dislodge them, so they would fall off. Due to an inadequately deep groove designed into the earpiece, the foam cover does not have a deep enough trough, or valley, to sink into, so it comes off extremely easily. Now I have no usable headphones. I'm surprised Phillips allowed such a flaw in their product.

Best bet is to set the size you want and basically tape it solid or any other method to lock the arms solid in place to the rest of the plastic.

Weak audio and a too-small size",1.0,Marshal,2025-04-22,"These headphones are lightweight, but that's about all that's going for them.The sound quality however leaves a bit to be desired: the bass really feels lackluster.Comfort-wise, these don't really fit to a head very well. The earcups are slightly rotated, so they can only fit in one direction on your head, which SHOULD improve ergonomics, but they still kinda place pressure on you if your head is at all larger. It *fits* but if you're like me you won't be able to wear them for very long like advertised. It's something you could probably get used to, but it's a major pain point for me.The cable is very long which at least is a plus, as so many headsets opt for a 3 ft cable it seems like.

I absolutely love these headphones. I own 2 pairs of AirPod Pros, BeatsFit Pro, Beats Powerbeats, and Beats Studio3.

I can listen to music while talking to others! Now I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing a bud while mowing the lawn. They‚Äôre perfect.

Considering its price range and sound quality, it offers a good deal",4.0,keepShopping101,2024-03-16,"The manufacturer has put effort into creating a good-quality yet inexpensive headset. It features a nicely painted smooth case with a power light indicator. One standout feature I appreciate is the recessed notch at the front where the power light LED is located, making it easy to open the case. I've had cheaper headsets in the past that were difficult to open, forcing me to file the edges manually to access them, which was very annoying. So, this case design is a welcome improvement. However, it lacks a power level percentage display, unlike my other cheaper headset cases that include this feature.Secondly, the headsets themselves boast larger speakers and don't stick into the ears; this is known as the open-ear feature in the design, which I appreciate. The headsets appear a bit bulky and wide, but they claim to offer 6 hours of listening time. I've tested them twice for four hours each time with a full charge, and they continued working beyond that timeframe. So, I'm satisfied with their battery life. Another great design aspect of the headset is that the ear hooks can be rotated and adjusted to fit different ear positions.One area for improvement is the detailing on the headsets, which appears a bit rough. Specifically, the edges of the external components, especially where they connect to the ear hooks that enable adjustment of the angle, have rough edges.Considering its price range and sound quality, it offers a good deal overall.",the United States,False,0,R19Z11W8930Q9E,0.1521604938271604,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Comfortable to wear, 4+ hour battery life on the headphones (1 week on the case), slightly expensive",4.0,Jay S,2024-03-16,"The video showcases the product in use.The video guides you through product setup.The video compares multiple products.The video shows the product being unpacked.Video Player is loading.Click to play videoPlayMuteCurrent Time¬†/Duration¬†Loaded: 0%Stream Type¬†LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time¬†-¬†1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions off, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.


This pair of true wireless on-ear bluetooth headphones have a 4+ hour runtime, and come with a charging/storage case that will top up the batteries on the headphones. I was able to go for over a week of intermittent usage before I was able to run both headphones and the storage case all the way down.Charging it back up takes 5v at 0.3 amps, so any USB port can do it, and the case does successfully negotiate and charge from a USB-C Power Delivery phone charger (or you can use the included USB-A to USB-C power cable with any standard square USB-A port).I found that I could put one headphone back into the case to charge while using the other one, and audio would switch seamlessly between the two headphones. They both include a microphone, so if one is in the charging case you can still make phone calls or do video conferencing with the other one, so it would be possible to use them continuously by swapping them back and forth into the charging case if you need more than 4 hours of continuous use.According to the manual each earphone has a 40 mAh battery, and the charging case has a 400 mAh battery. The power it drew when re-charging from empty was consistent with a total battery capacity of 480 mAh so I believe the specifications in the manual.As with any bluetooth audio device, there is a very faint lag/delay in the audio when compared to a wired headphone. This is not terribly noticeable when watching videos or even doing video conferencing, but if you play games you may notice it.  I noticed it only when editing videos, as the audio would play for just a fraction of a second more after I'd hit the stop button.  If this bothers you, you can triple tap the left headphone to switch to ""game mode"", which uses a lower latency codec and almost completely reduces the lag. [Supposedly the game mode audio codec doesn't deliver quite as high quality audio as the regular one, but I couldn't tell a difference...perhaps that is an indication that the overall sound quality isn't excellent...but they perform exactly as I would expect for an on-ear headphone with such small speaker elements.]I prefer on-ear to ""in-ear-canal"" headphones and like the ""over the ear"" hook. I never had one fall out on me (but was not doing anything strenuous). I wear them with glasses on, and they did not interfere with the glasses and were comfortable, even combined with the glasses over the ear as well.My only complaint about these earphones:The ""touch"" area on each earphone is just a slight depression in the plastic, and does not give any tactile feedback like a button click. Even worse, it does not beep or indicate that your touch has been registered in any way.  Plus,  sometimes it takes a while for the change you are asking for to take effect.So it took a bit of trial and error to figure out the right ""speed"" at which to ""double tap"" to have the earphones register it as a double tap instead of two single taps.  The ""press and hold"" to raise or lower the volume is easy, and the single tap to play/pause works well, but expect to have to practice some of the double-click (to answer a phone call, or advance to the next track) or triple click (game mode or voice assistant) to get them to work reliably.The price point is higher than I'd like, but not so high that it feels unfair.  I am happy with their comfort and performance, and plan to use them as my primary set of wireless earphones.  In fit and comfort, they remind me very much of my single ear Jabra wireless headset.  To be a great deal I feel they shoudld be at the $50 price point.",the United States,False,0,R1YA23Z0RDEQ85,0.0876220855168223,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Worked with my Quest 3; don't fit in ear, so they might feel loose to some people",5.0,Michael JC,2024-03-10,"I wanted some earbuds that would work with my Meta Quest 3, which requires low latency Bluetooth if choosing to go wireless. The website says 35ms, though I think the documentation says 40ms. I tried these out with both Beat Saber and watching a movie with Skybox. These worked perfectly. I did not notice any kind of lag. The audio seemed spot on to me.These were very easy to pair, and they are very easy to use. They power on when you open the included case, and they power off when you put them back in the case. The case charges the earbuds. You can plug in the case to charge it.These are not like most earbuds. They do not fit in your ears. Instead, you have the piece that fits over your ear, and the electronic portion sits outside your ear. They can be adjusted up or down to line up with your ear. The fit is a little bit weird, and I don‚Äôt think it will be for everyone. Since they don‚Äôt sit in your ear, there is a sensation of them being loose and that they could fall off. I did not have any issues with them staying on, so I don‚Äôt think they will fall off, but it does feel as though they are less secure.I think the sound quality is fine, but I‚Äôm not an audiophile, so I‚Äôm not that hard to please.

I was looking for headphones to use while working out. So,  they need to be light and have some noise-cancelling with decent sound quality. This product meets all those criteria.The connection was effortless upon opening the box. It has an app that makes it easy to set the sound.It's very light; not too tight. The only issue is that ear covers are small, so it may be an issue for large ears. I do have large ears, so it fits a little tight, but not too uncomfortable, since ear covers are cushioned.The material looks ok for the purpose.I tried the noise canceling, and it does the job. I would say that it blocks 50-60% of noise. That is enough for me.In summary, these headphones are great for the price.",the United States,True,7,R190G7G3EY3IA3,0.1100153793574846,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Review From a Producer/Audiophile",5.0,ljwojo,2025-09-22,"Keep in mind this is all taking into account price as well. Even then, this is still super good.Let‚Äôs start off with the EQ, the low end is a very good boost, I have it turned ALL the way up and it isn‚Äôt boxy or muddy, it might just be the way I set up the EQ around the low end, but it‚Äôs super good quality even after boosting the bass. I did the same with the Spotify EQ and now it‚Äôs double the bass‚Ä¶you can imagine how that goes üòõI boosted the high end a little and I just have no words, it‚Äôs super high quality for this price, I bought these at best buy and I looked up the same model, and surely, here they were.The noise canceling is really good if you think about it. Unless you‚Äôre at an airport and using transparent mode, you‚Äôll barely be hearing any noise anyway, even without ANC.

I barely recall when it DID work, so it's hard to give much of a full review.I had higher hopes for these, and I am a bit disappointed at spending the money on a non-functioning pair of headphones.I would try them again if I could just make them operational.

I‚Äôll also mention I used the headphones straight out of the box and have had them on the entire day up until now where I‚Äôm writing this review. So like 12 hours using them and they‚Äôre not dead yet. My airpods would be dead ten times over already. Honestly insane headphones for $25. And bluetooth on top of that.",the United States,False,1,R1ZKP3VP3JBVVI,0.0676470588235294,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Just like my JBL‚Äôs. Great value, good sound, like-new condition",5.0,Raj Against The Machine,2025-03-12,"I just had these delivered and am trying them out now. These seem almost like a copy of my JBL 510BT set which I‚Äôve had for at least a few years and used almost daily. One of the volume button on that pair failed; which it works fine otherwise, and I can still control its volume with either the phone or PC controls if needed, I decided it was time for a newer cheaper set.These Amazon Basics headphones have surprisingly clear sound quality; to my ears that means clarity and channel separation. There‚Äôs bass too; these aren‚Äôt gonna match up to Beats but I‚Äôve never tried Beats or other bass-heavy audio, and I probably never will. But the sound comes alive in my head.The shape, controls, and fit are almost identical to my JBL‚Äôs. The buttons look almost identical, as does the status LED.  I turned them on out of the box; they were ready to pair. My phone picked it up easily, and they were ready to use. Just like that. Nice thing is these were so much cheaper than the JBL‚Äôs that I don‚Äôt particularly care what happens to them. These will be perfect for the office, traveling, and other away-from-home uses.For conference calls using Teams, and phone calls, voices are clear. I‚Äôm also told my voice comes through clearly with little to no ambient noise. I mainly use these at the office in an open environment. The mute button doesn‚Äôt exactly sync with Teams on my laptop, but neither did my old set, so no big deal.",the United States,True,14,RD9O5FJM4F4Z8,0.1337797619047619,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Connects 25% of the time",1.0,Z,2025-01-28,"I wanted to try less expensive wireless headphones as I'm a heavy user (at least 12hr daily) and I'm tired of more expensive headsets dying/breaking on me. Maybe if the cheaper option was halfway decent, then I could end up spending less even if I had to replace the headphones more, I thought. I was wrong. I haven't even had them a week and already I'm having connection issues with every single device I own - issues I never had with more expensive wireless headphones. It's genuinely frustrating having to re-pair every time I want to switch from my laptop to my phone because the headset paired to both refuses to switch between them. The only saving grace is how long these last; I've only had to charge them every other day. I will not be purchasing again, and I suggest you splurge a bit to get a better, higher end set of headphones, too.",the United States,True,7,RQ8FH8SQ4TABX,-0.0359623015873016,2025-10-07T14:14:00

If you don't like pressure point pain don't buy these. You can only wear them for like 10-15 minutes before you start to get ear pain. If the earpads were larger these would be a great buy. So if you have a kid say in the age range of 6-10 years old these would be fine. If you are an adult... sound is great but you deal with the ear pain.

I also have a big head, and these headphones fit comfortably with enough room to adjust.In contrast, I also have some SONY headphones, but surprisingly, these headphones are even better and more comfortable. I can wear them for hours at a time without any discomfort. What really impresses me, however, is the battery life.

Not as easy to install as they claim, but works well",4.0,JImw,2024-03-05,"The installation instructions tell you to remove the old pads (easy enough), then to insert the pad's lip into the gap at the top, then work your way around the gap, inserting the lip as you make your way around the earphone.  Good luck with that.  The fit is so tight that when you put the top in the bottom comes out, and vice versa.  If you have very long, nimble fingers, or three hands like one of those AI generated people, you might be able to accomplish this.  Fortunately, the lip seems very durable, so I found a different method that worked better for me.  I stretched the lip past the gap and past the silver highlight plastic so that it fit behind the cup and was held in place by the band armature.  Then I stretched it to the bottom while holding the top securely by folding the ear cup against the band.  This allowed me to keep the top on while stretching to the bottom.  After it was completely around the earphones, I was able to maneuver the lip into the gap more easily.After the installation, all that's left is to go back to enjoying your music.  Even if the installation is like installing a full size fitted sheet on a queen size mattress, the results are worth it.This installation was on a Hesh 2 Wireless headset.  Different headsets may install slightly differently.The photo shows where I pulled the lip of the earpad cushion. When you push the earpad back against the headband, you can hold the earpad cushion in place while you try to stretch the earpad cushion lip around the earpad to the bottom.",the United States,True,2,R3AK4I8F39Y8IO,0.2021498599439775,2025-10-07T14:14:00

If You Don‚Äôt Want to Deal With an App, Get the Previous Model",4.0,Ivy,2025-06-15,"I had a previous version of these, which had started to peel around the ear cushions, but otherwise worked great. The sound quality was wonderful, but the previous version had gone up over $30 in price (basically double the price of the new ones), so I replaced my old pair with this one. With the old ones, you turn them on, pair them with Bluetooth, and it says battery high, medium, or low. With these new ones, you have to download an app and check the app for battery level, which is a pain. I think the new ones may have a slightly longer battery life (which was already great) and the app is useful because it tells you battery percentage, but I still think it‚Äôs a pain. I thought about exchanging them for my old ones but decided to keep the new ones instead.

A truly impressive Audio Experience!",5.0,Amy Macs 757,2025-10-03,"‚ÄãSony WH-CH720N‚ÄãI am absolutely thrilled and genuinely impressed with my new Sony WH-CH720N wireless headphones! Knowing I was buying a Sony product instilled a high level of confidence from the start, and these headphones have completely exceeded my expectations. They deliver the premium quality the brand is known for, but at an incredibly accessible price point.‚ÄãThe sound quality is nothing short of phenomenal. The audio is rich, vibrant, and remarkably well-balanced, providing a deeply immersive listening experience whether I'm enjoying complex classical scores, bass-heavy electronic tracks, or simply listening to a podcast. What takes the audio a step further is the brilliant ability to customize the equalizer settings directly on the companion app. Being able to fine-tune the acoustics to perfectly match my personal listening preference is a massive feature that truly makes a difference.‚ÄãBeyond the magnificent sound, the Noise Cancellation (NC) feature is a real game-changer. It creates a serene bubble, effortlessly muting the distractions of the outside world‚Äîwhether it's the chatter of a busy office, the low hum of an airplane, or street traffic. This powerful noise-blocking capability, combined with the stellar audio, allows me to fully immerse myself in the music.‚ÄãIf you are seeking headphones that blend top-tier sound performance, effective noise cancellation, and Sony's renowned quality, the WH-CH720N is an absolute must-buy.

Good sound and lightweight.",5.0,manny,2025-09-09,I wanted some light headphones that sound great but dont get in the way during a gym session. Noise cancellation has some good reduction but its about 75% of outside sound. They are also useful if you want to wear them during a study session to not hear anything. At around $100 i think they provide good value for the money because the sound quality is pretty good for the price bracket they belong to.Portablity isnt very good because they dont fold and if you wear them on your neck they dont fold so that the cups face you so you wouldnt be able to protect them from rain or the outside environment.

The audio quality is okay, it often sounds like I'm listening through a can.  They don't fold up nicely and there isn't a carrying case or anything for them, so if you have a dusty house they will get dirty.

My new favorite ANC headphones for VR gaming\movies",5.0,Kevin R.,2025-10-01,"Review for Soundcore Life Q30.Ok i'm finally making this review after several months.I love these things. I originally bought them for my gym sessions as earbuds never stay in my ears, but i could only get through half a workout before my ears got too hot and sweaty with these on, but that's not a negative at all.I always wear over the ear headphones and these fit great. The ear cups are nice and soft and seal well. Plenty of tension against the ears to seal and block outside noise (with ANC on). Has plenty of adjustment in the band to fir my small daughter's head and mine.With ANC on and equalizer in your music app adjusted properly, these things sound great. With no equalizer, they're mostly flat, but a bit muddled so an equalizer is a must.They connected through bluetooth very easily, no problem there.I began using them, over my old MPOW headphones, for my VR movies on my quest 3. The ANC is so much better than my MPOW where. Battery life is great and charging them to full only takes like 2-3hrs.",the United States,True,1,R2NLHWAHZ22U9M,0.2250694444444444,2025-10-07T14:14:00

I would take them off mid flight and feel like i was getting bombarded from the plane noise. They are bulky but sooo worth it. I dont even use them for anything else.

Four years later, a solid choice for this price bracket",5.0,Zachary N Rawlings,2025-09-24,"I've been using these headphones for the last four years, so this is the 'wear and tear' review.  TLDR: they're a good buy.  Don't depend on the microphone.  Life cycle is about four-five years before comfort items will wear out.Firstly, the positives.  These headphones make beautiful sound.  I've used them for everything from meetings where I need clear communication to hours of bass singers on youtube.  The range, the precision, the fidelity, all very good.The noise cancelling feature works well, and I particularly love the Transparency mode that allows me to still tell when my boss wants my attention while I'm jamming tunes.After three years of constant use, the battery life is still measured in days of continuous sound.  I can usually get three days (36 hours, I don't turn them off when I leave) with Transparency active in Bluetooth mode before I need to charge them.Now the negatives.  There are a few construction flaws that this model suffers from.  The material used to cover the foam on the earpieces is a kind of fake leather, and the seam is glued, not sewn, so after a year or two of use I found the adhesive would fail and the seam split, allowing the foam inside to make contact with my ears.  I fixed it by sewing it up myself, but it's still kind of annoying.  Also the fake leather is starting to disintegrate after three years of daily use.There is a feature of this model that allows the user to change Noise Cancelling modes by tapping the side of one earphone.  This appears to function by having some tiny bit inside that detects the tap and changes the mode.  I know this because it doesn't take very long before this tiny bit detaches and starts rattling around in there, and the 'tap' function stops working.  The first one of these I purchased, the tiny bit detached in such a manner that it would change modes every time I turned my head.  I contacted the manufacturer, and it was replaced under warranty, no questions asked.  (I still have that old one, as long as I don't turn it on and use a headphone cord with it, it still works great.)  My second one broke in about the same time frame, but the little doohicky inside fell down in a different manner so it doesn't bother me.  Honestly the 'tap' function is cool, but it's a gimmick I could do without, and have for the last three years.The microphone kinda sucks.  I don't use it.  Folks say it makes me sound like I'm underwater.Lastly there are some plastic bits where the headphone band meets the headband padding that break over time.  Again, it took years, but they've cracked and long-haired users can get strands caught in these crevices.  I still find it comfortable to wear, but I have short guy hair.To summarize, I recommend these headphones to anyone.  I have worn them continuously for four years in my office, and they have stood the test with a reasonable amount of wear and tear damage.  I have purchased them for my wife and my children, and that kid uses his headphones more than I do.  They are well suited to voice communication, gaming, and music.  My next purchase will probably be this brand, and probably without that stupid 'tap' function.",the United States,True,0,R3N1HZLVN1FM6G,0.0624206349206349,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Decent Headphones for Studying and the Gym, with a Minor Durability Issue",4.0,Daniel A,2025-09-19,"The Anker Soundcore 30s are a solid pair of headphones that offer a great audio experience for their price point. The sound quality is impressive, with a good balance of bass and clear highs that make listening to music, podcasts, and audiobooks a real pleasure. The battery life is also excellent, lasting through extended listening sessions without needing a recharge. I've found them particularly useful for both focused studying and for lifting sessions at the gym. They stay in place well and provide a great audio backdrop for whatever I'm doing.Comfort-wise, they are generally good for long-term use. The earcup design is comfortable, and the headphones are lightweight enough that they don't cause fatigue. However, I did encounter one significant durability issue: the lining in the ear muffs tore after a few months of use. While this was a disappointment, I was able to find and replace the earpads, and the headphones have been performing well ever since.Overall, the Anker Soundcore 30s are a fantastic value. They deliver on the core aspects of what makes a good pair of headphones‚Äîsound quality and battery life‚Äîand are very comfortable. The tear in the earcup lining was a notable flaw, but it's a fixable one. If you're looking for an affordable pair of headphones with great sound for both productive and active use, and are willing to potentially replace the earpads down the line, these are an excellent choice.",the United States,True,0,R17U3YWDX3MIUF,0.3535370370370371,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Well built for the price",5.0,Tzen lee,2025-09-18,"Pretty good for the price on sale. Solid for my first set of noise cancelling headphones. To be straight forward I just feel like it could have been better with bass and noise leak. As I really want to rock to my new headphones, but in the end with a bit of tweaking in the app it sounds better I guess. And the second caveot is how I'm at 50% or above the volume and it already leaks my music towards all to hear. It ain't as bad, but in a quiet room with few others. I bet they can hear me bobbing to my bops.But the biggest pros that I would give them is they sound good for just 50$, noise cancellation works pretty alright. And quality is definitely there, even tho I just now read on Reddit that some parts are fragile and may be prone to breaking. I really hope not, as they feel solid with good materials and are comfortable. As I have a big head, and the ear cups are just so soft.For the price and quality of the build, I would say they are a worthy pickup. As much as I would like to spend 100-200$ on other brands. These just fits the budget I'm at at the moment, for those movie late nights and morning motivation beats and muse, they will do the job just fine. Plus they are made with Anker, the guys that makes portable power banks, thus far I'm still at 90% battery, which is a bonus. I've wore mines for the whole day, ever since they arrived at t 6am in the morning. Pretty much am well accustomed to them now.Also I like how I can use 2 devices at once with them too. While playing PC games to just doom scrolliing on my phone. Without making too much of a racket, which is very very nice.Overall, good if you're on a budget. But best try to get em on sale. They also seem to have cheaper and more expensive options too of different models.",the United States,True,4,R1GWQNSNYK4144,0.1895454545454546,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Not thrilled with the updates that make the product worse than the previous version",3.0,Page One,2025-09-11,"This is my second time buying these exact same headphones. I thought they would be the same, but some of the programming (is that the correct word for it?) has been changed. A piece of the plastic broke just above the earcups broke a few days ago, so I figured I'd replace them with the same model, a good deal for the price. When I turned the old version on, it would say battery high or battery medium, or battery low, but this new version doesn't tell you how the battery is. Why, knowing how much battery life you have is important. I would charge them when I stopped using them anytime it didn't say battery high when I turned them on. How am I supposed to know how much battery time I have left? I go to sleep later than my wife, so these are great for watching TV. Also, there are 3 listening modes, transparency, normal, and noise canceling which again  when you switched told you which mode it was in, but this new version just has a tone instead. I don't understand tones, I understand words. Why do companies have to make changes that make the product worse?

The only qualms are that the volume could be a tad lighter (though I know my poor ears would say otherwise) and the function button on the sides aren‚Äôt as intuitive as leading competitors.I love how the ear pieces are snug on my head and never fall off even when I‚Äôm dripping sweat on a long run.  The charge time is super quick and the battery is long lasting. These pair easily and don‚Äôt randomly disconnect during a phone call. I‚Äôve been mentioning this brand to everyone I can. Stop chasing after a name and chase after quality. I‚Äôd buy these again in a heartbeat.",the United States,True,0,RBC6MQJ3KAKUZ,0.0785714285714285,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Less comfortable than before",3.0,I.S.,2025-05-28,"I bought a white pair in April 2024 and used them daily until I bought a replacement black pair in April 2025. The white ones were very comfortable, but the plastic connections to both earphones eventually broke (early 2025). I used them very often and loved the sound.The new pair, however, is far less comfortable than the previous pair even though I purchased from the exact same listing. It is far tighter and regularly gives me headaches, which the old ones did not do even when they were new. They clearly made some changes (as the new ones no longer silence music to announce that noise cancelling is on/off, but instead speak over it, which I do prefer) and it feels like they made them tighter while doing so. I'll have to buy different ones because I cannot put up with the headaches, even if the sound quality is great.Sound quality is good and the earphones themselves are comfortable.

A little pricey, but not bad.",4.0,Mike,2025-10-01,"I paid $90 for these and I'm not mad, but I'm not over the moon either.I think JBL headphones always sound good. I also have a pair of the Endurance Peak 3 earbuds that I love. I purchased these because I have weird shaped ears and the earbuds never really stay snug like they should. I have a pretty massive head, so the Tune headphones are pretty snug, but not uncomfortably so.They are snug enough that I could wear them wile riding my motorcycle at highway speeds without having to worry about them falling off. They are relatively open to wind noise, however. If you are just walking around, it is not an issue, but at speed on my motorcycle, all I could hear was wind without turning them up too loud.I do not like active noise cancelling and I think it's a waste of money, that is why I purchased a pair without it. I feel that if you're a pedestrian, these headphones block out just enough noise while allowing you to be somewhat aware of what's going on around you.The most important thing to me that JBL brings t o market besides the quality of the product itself is their control app. The app lets you change the button functions, but most importantly, gives you a pretty surgical EQ to customize your sound. If you have any kind of audio mixing experience, this feature is actually pretty awesome.I think $90 is a little steep for the build quality. I think they feel like they're going to break at any moment. I would like al little more heft to them. I think maybe $60 to $75 might be more like it, but $90 isn't crazy.

Well-made pair of headphones",5.0,Catharine M,2025-08-21,"These are very good quality headphones, especially for the price. They're comfortable, provide reasonable sound quality and noise cancellation, and the equalizer can be tuned via an app. At under $30, I would definitely recommend giving them a try.- Sound Quality -I was impressed by the sound quality using the stock settings. The bass is slightly boosted by default, though it isn't blown out and doesn't overpower the mids and highs, which both come across clearly. If you aren't a fan of the defaults, though, then you can adjust the equalizer using an app to fit your tastes, a nice extra feature that I'm glad budget brands are starting to implement. It should be noted that these headphones do not support LDAC, if that's important to you.- Active Noise Cancellation -The ANC on these is decent, but nothing to write home about. It's togged by a dedicated button on the side of the headphones, next to the volume control. I felt moderate pressure in my ears when I wasn't playing music, but not to an uncomfortable degree. By itself, the ANC does a decent job of filtering out static and low-frequency noise, like running fans, but less-so other dynamic sounds, like the neighbor's music or people talking. While playing music, though, I wasn't bothered either by outside noise or the pressure on my inner ears. Overall, the ANC is adequate, but these might not be the best choice if you're specifically looking for headphones with great ANC.- Comfort -These headphones fit very well, and the cushions feel very nice on both my ears and the top of my head. Notably, I found that I could wear these comfortably even while wearing (small hoop) earrings, which is usually something I have trouble with. They aren't the tightest - you likely couldn't wear these while jogging, not that you'd want to with this type of headphone... - but for sitting at a desk or a casual walk these will work well. Overall I'm very impressed by how comfortable these are.- Functionality -One of my pet peeves is loud, intrusive voices when you use the controls on headphones - instead, these use mild tones to announce power on/off and successful pairing. Turning on and off ANC does have a voice, but it's not overly loud and doesn't stop or silence your music, just briefly lowers the volume. Earlier I mentioned app control - on Android the app is fairly glitchy with a lot of UI issues, including some elements blocked by the nav bar, but I was able to do everything I needed to despite this. The app does prompt you to create an account, but this is optional. Lastly, the controls on the headphones were a bit odd - the volume up and down positions were the opposite of where I expected them to be - but once you get used to them it's easy and fast to do all of the main functions, like ANC, play/pause, skipping, and volume changes. Volume can be adjusted quickly, since those buttons do not share a quick-press functionality; skipping is done by holding rather than a double press, which I appreciate.",the United States,False,0,R3BU48LLOCL0PQ,0.2119401709401709,2025-10-07T14:14:00

These are good headphones, not great headphones; features include phone calls",4.0,pandr,2025-06-22,"The box comes with everything you need to function with these headphones: charging cord, audio jack, manual, app setup brochure, and warranty card. The warranty covers defects from one year from original purchase. I charged the headphones before using them. You do not need the app to connect to your bluetooth device (phone or computer) to use the headphones. If wanted, the app adds additional features like equalizer settings. The headphones are lightweight. There is no clear indication which way to wear the headphones, although from the angle of the earpads, the controls earpad would be on the left. As for the fit, the headband is a little loose on me and fits my adult son using the extension; the earpads fit comfortably for me and are too small for my adult son‚Äôs ears‚Äîthey compress his larger ears and he needs to take them off periodically to relieve the pressure. The earpads fold in the headband to be compact for storage. When folding the earpads in, the hinge sounds like it is breaking every time, which is unsettling to me. The earpads do not turn sideways, which means they do not lay flat against your chest when carrying around the neck. The pads on the earpads are fairly soft. The power button, also known as the multi-function button (MFB) turns the headphones on or off with a long press. There is an increasing pitch sound with a ‚Äúpop‚Äù for ‚Äúon‚Äù and a decreasing pitch sound ending in a ‚Äúpop‚Äù sound for ‚Äúoff‚Äù. Then there are +/- buttons to control volume. Finally, there is the mode button which turns noise cancelling on or off. I have been using the headphones without the app, and the audio is satisfactory. When I turn noise cancelling (ANC) on, the background noise is reduced and still noticeable enough to have awareness of my surroundings; the thing I don‚Äôt like is that the volume of what I‚Äôm listening to increases. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is that the headphones do not maintain ANC status. When the headphones are turned off, the noise cancelling is turned off; you need to turn it back on every time. An additional useful feature is that you can use the headphones for phone calls. If the headset is connected to your phone and a call comes in, what you are listening to will pause and you will hear the ‚Äúring‚Äù through the headset. You can answer by short press of the MFB (power button) or if you answer via your phone, you will need to change the ‚Äúaudio‚Äù to reconnect the call through the headset. Either way, the call can be fully conducted through the headset. There is no indication of how much charge is left. I did not track the exact time, but my perception is that the charge does not last long‚ÄîI think a few days when the headphones were not in use. This is made in China. Overall, these headphones are a mix of useful functions and so-so quality, with decent audio. You‚Äôll have to weigh the features with how they might fit you with the cost to decide if they are right for you.",the United States,False,1,R2W3KJTW91XS6M,0.1069987610428786,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Good budget headphones with usable ANC",4.0,TheTJ,2025-06-11,"The box contains the headphones, a USB-C to USB-A charging cable, and a male to male 3.5mm stereo wire.  My headphones came with about a 70% charge out of the box, so I immediately tried them out.  Audio quality is decent, but definitely a little muddy especially in the mids and highs.  Their app does have an EQ that you can use to tune them to your preferences, but when trying to use a custom EQ, the sound output was greatly reduced, even with everything increased to max, which makes that basically worthless and you're forced to use one of the presets.  I prefer the Jazz or Blue presets.  I did not test call quality. Audio Quality - 6/10Build quality seems decent, not too heavy and aren't too tight so you should be able to wear them for a long time without issue.  The faux leather ear cups are comfortable and don't trap in heat, even when I was using them while mowing my lawn.  Unfortunately they don't seem to be removable or replaceable so you're stuck with them.  They can fold up to make them slightly easier to pack into a backpack, but the ear cups don't rotate, so they won't pack flat. Build quality - 7/10Feature wise, this does what you expect from it but does include the ability to pair to 2 devices at once, which I didn't test.  The physical buttons (power, volume -/+) allow you to control your media: pause (short press power button), skip (long press + volume) and rewind media (long press - volume), as well as a dedicated button to enable ANC.  Everything you need but that's it.  7/10Battery life seems pretty good so far.  After about 2 hours of use with ANC on, it's showing 90% battery remaining.  They advertise 50 hours of use, but based on my usage, ANC will probably reduce that to 20 hours or so, but it should still last long enough for most tasks or flights before needing to be recharged.Some parts of the Havit app were in Chinese which required me to run a screenshot through Google Translate. Skip the app unless you want to use a different EQ.  That's about all the app is useful for.",the United States,False,3,R1Q8ND3H886RME,0.0713410364145658,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Middle-range ANC headphones",4.0,James K,2025-06-08,"My impressions of these have been largely good. The sound quality is quite good. There's a great range of tones, with full-enough bass and good clarity. These headphones are pretty light, but they don't feel cheap. They are comfortable to wear, and I think they'll be a great multipurpose set of headphones. As with many less-expensive noise-cancelling headphones, I feel like the ANC is decent but not outstanding. If you're looking to erase all environmental sound, you'll probably need to spend more. But these do cancel out some sound. They've paired smoothly. Only time will tell how they last, but early signs are positive. This seems like a pretty solid value. They feel better than most of the cheap headphones we've used, and while they're not up to Sony or JBL or Beats, they feel solidly in the middle.",the United States,False,0,R3LKAQHQX21EVD,0.3247835497835498,2025-10-07T14:14:00

The have a full, rich sound, with plenty of 'equalizer' controls and options. They are extremely comfortable, too. I was able to pair them right away to my phone using the QR code to get the app. I have not figured out how to pair them to my laptop yet, and the Noise Cancelling function does not do as much as I thought it would, which is why I took off 1 star. In the meantime, it comes with a a patch cable so I am still able to use them with my laptop. In fact, listing to some Jackson Browne while I am writing this review. The patch cable is plenty long enough, and it also comes with a short USB-C charging cable. Overall, I am very pleased.UPDATE: I raised this to 5 stars. My neighbor was out power-washing something for hours this morning and the noise was driving me nuts. I put these headphones on and selected 'Noise Reduction' and the noise all but vanished!!!!!

Easy to use, good value for $",4.0,Natalie,2025-06-01,"Overall these are a nice set of headphones. I have another pair of expensive noise cancelling wireless headphones and for me I would rather these and save the $200+. They do a decent job of noise cancelling but you can still have some awareness of what is going on around you. I have 6 kids so I like this tbh but if you want total blackout from sound, you will be disappointed. They pair easily and stay charged a long time.My only real gripe with these is that they are large and bulky. Even closed to the smallest size they are too large for me, and my adult male husband and teenage son. They do stay on ok but they are not snug and since they are not snug you can hear what I am listening to when on the higher volume. The overall headphone is large too.

light bluetooth headphones with poor audio quality and ANC",1.0,Barefoot Birdie,2025-05-29,"First, the audio quality is pretty awful for music. I compared it to various other headphones, both fully-enclosed like these, as well as on-ear earbuds. The Havit headphones sounded the worst. The music was muddy and muffled, and just sounded bad. I tested them both via bluetooth and wired. In all cases, the Havit headphones sounded quite bad.For active noise cancelling, I compared it to two other ANC headphones and only the Havit produced a constant hiss, as well as failed to block the nearby computer fan noises the other headphones were able to block. Granted, the others were in a higher price bracket.The controls are confusing, especially with the diagram showing them flipped around instead of in the orientation you see when you look at the headphones normally. The control buttons are also difficult to tell apart, and I kept confusing the power and bluetooth pairing buttons, for example. They need to be better distinguished by touch, and the markings more clear.When unfolding, there's a sharp ""click"", but given their light weight it feels like you're about to break them each time they're opened.They are light and quite comfortable, with padding that's easy on the ears, and inexpensive.

Soundcore by Anker Space One ‚Äì Review  ‚≠ê Rating: 4.3 / 5",4.0,Magda Nino,2025-10-03,"Noise Cancelling:The standout feature of the Space One is its Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) performance. The 2X Stronger Voice Reduction lives up to the claim, effectively lowering background chatter and ambient noise. While it may not reach the level of premium brands like Bose or Sony, it delivers impressive results for its price point‚Äîmaking it excellent for commuting, working in noisy environments, or focusing at home.Sound Quality:The headphones provide a well-balanced sound signature with clear mids and highs, along with punchy but not overpowering bass. They‚Äôre great for a wide range of genres, from podcasts and classical to pop and hip-hop.Comfort & Build:Lightweight with plush ear cushions, they can be worn for hours without discomfort. The adjustable headband fits securely, and the overall build feels sturdy and stylish.Battery Life:One of the best features‚Äîup to 40 hours of playtime with ANC on, and even longer without it. Fast charging also ensures you can get hours of playback from just a short charge.Controls & Features:Easy-to-use touch and button controls make adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and toggling ANC straightforward. The app integration adds customization options like EQ adjustments.Pros:Strong ANC with noticeable voice reduction.Comfortable, lightweight fit.Long battery life (up to 40 hours).Customizable sound via the Soundcore app.Great value compared to higher-end competitors.Cons:ANC is excellent for voices but doesn‚Äôt completely block very low-frequency sounds.Slightly bulkier design compared to slim models.Call quality is good but not exceptional in very noisy environments.Overall Impression:The Soundcore by Anker Space One headphones are an outstanding mid-range option. They offer powerful ANC, excellent comfort, and long-lasting battery life at a fraction of the price of premium brands.

Good value for the money",4.0,Nobody,2025-09-16,"*UPDATE*WARNING: These do NOT come with a USB dongle like most wireless headphones do, so if your machine doesn't have Bluetooth, you're out of luck.My initial impressions after 1 day of use.Build: mid grade, probably won't stand up to any kind of abuseAudio quality: good, default is bass heavy so audiophiles will probably play with the EQ immediately, but other use cases will like itMicrophone: It works fine, nothing to write home aboutComfort: I wore it for 8hrs straight no problems. It got a bit warm, but not too bad. I was fine wearing it for the dayCables: LOL they don't deserve the name. They are literally about 6"" long. The company was just checking a box when they included them. Nobody is going to use these. They fully expect you to use your phone or game device's USB-C charging cable / audio connectorNoise cancelling: For clarification, this reduces the sound of talking, not all noise. It doesn't eliminate the talking either, I can still hear people talking around me at work with it on, it just doesn't distract me as much. You'll want Bose or something if you really want noise cancelling, but for reducing office noise at work they're fineBattery life: I only used it for 8hrs straight, but the battery was still ""high"" at the endCharging speed: very fast (1hr to full)Recommendation: These are ideal for people that want to listen to music at work and reduce (not eliminate) office noise. They are also good for gamers.

Above average noise canceling, I question the build quality",3.0,kshudson,2025-09-09,"I purchased this based on the nytimes wire cutter article that recommended these as the best budget option. My experience was that the noise cancelling was average to above average and was a big improvement over the noise cancelling I experienced with an older version of Beats Studio pro 3 headphones and also a pair of beats earbuds. In an open office floor setting, the headphones blocked out a significant amount of the conversations happening around me and I was able to focus on my work. I ultimately ended up returning it for two reasons 1) because the build quality of the headphones wasn‚Äôt as high as I expected.  It feels a little flimsy compared to my older beats headphones and I was already noticing some discoloration on the ear pads after the first day 2) from a style standpoint they are larger and bulkier and I felt a little uncomfortable wearing themI do think they‚Äôre a good value for the money and my daughter liked them enough that I bought a pair for her.

Faulty headphones but good customer service",3.0,Erika M Blomdahl,2025-09-01,"These headphones look sleek but the sound quality is awful. There is this glitchy sound that distorts music that occurs very frequently. It's like that sound when you are starting to get too far out of range with bluetooth headphones, except that I am sitting right at the computer my headphones are paired to so it's not a distance problem. I've tried removing and repairing but it doesn't fix it. I don't know if I just have a dud? My headphones did seem used when they arrived (some scratches and markings), but I don't mind a gently used item if it still works normally so I just accepted that. At first the distortion sound was every couple songs and was easy-ish to ignore, but it's gotten so much worse lately, now it's every 15-30 secs, which renders these headphones actually unusable to me it's so annoying.UPDATE: customer service was helpful and responsive to resolve the matter, so I am revising my review to reflect that although the headphones I have don't work well the customer service was solid.

I left them overnight, and tried the next day and still got that every time I turned them on.I talked to Amazon support and said that they must be defective, and arranged an exchange with no problem.The new ones showed up, I charged them on  a less than 5 V charger, and got the same problem.It turns out that the headphones can verbally report the battery charge level when you turn them on.  They have the totally normal thing to say when the battery is fully charged: ""battery high.""  They have another message if there is a battery problem: ""battery hot.""  Unfortunately, the message isn't clear enough for my ears to have made the distinction.I feel bad that I exchanged a perfectly good headphone (that will probably go into the trash)  for another one.I have barely had time to use them, but noise cancellation seems really good.

My XM4's died at 13 months,  just out of warranty. Both ear cups snapped off the headrest, and the ANC failed and would contantly feedback, making them unwearable. These Soundcore's are bassier,  with a more dynamic and louder soundscape than the Sony's. And the Ap allows for ultimate customization.

It is more complete for its price",5.0,Erick,2025-08-20,"Personally, I consider these headphones to be the best for under $100. In terms of construction, they feel very good, despite being made of plastic, it is a good quality plastic with an excellent finish and also with excellent padding. In fact, I think they are some of the most comfortable headphones I have tried and comparable to high-end headphones from Sony. They can be used for hours and the truth is that they do not bother at all. The floating axis makes them fit very well in the ears, without a doubt, this is one of their strong points. Another point that is comparable to Sony headphones is some lifestyle functions, such as pausing a video or music as soon as you remove the headphones or playing them as soon as you put them on since they have a proximity sensor. Another very good feature is being able to activate ambient mode by simply placing your hand on the left earbud or also activating ambient mode just by starting to speak. The noise cancellation is automatically deactivated and reactivates when you stop speaking for about 4 seconds. Great!!  These ""lifestyle"" features didn't seem useful to me at first, but if you're someone who uses them outdoors, like on the street or while traveling, they're features that make your life easier when having a conversation with someone. I've only seen these features in some Sony products. In terms of noise cancellation, they perform well for their price. I don't think there's currently any headphone that cancels 100% noise, not even the Sony ones, which are the best in this regard. Their app is great; I'd say one of the best. It's very intuitive and highly configurable, especially the ""HearID"" audio setup feature. The audio is good; I'd say it's not their strongest point, but if you're someone who can use an equalizer, you can significantly improve the sound from the app. Their charging time and battery life are good, as is their design; they're very aesthetic and modern.  I think the only thing missing was a hard case, as it comes with a cloth bag (very nice and good quality), but considering the price and all the features of the headphones, I don't know if that would be a negative point. Overall, I think it was a good buy for $100 or even less, as there are other brands like QCY or SOUNDPEATS, but these Soundcore headphones are the most complete, definitely a good purchase.",the United States,True,6,R18IZ7SDGQD5MJ,0.3752127659574468,2025-10-07T14:14:00

MY FAVORITE HEADPHONES OF ALL TIME! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5.0,Ehren,2025-08-13,"I don't leave reviews too often. Most of the time, I just simply don't want to make the effort.. HOWEVER, after using these, I simply HAD to leave a review for these beauties! HOLY MOLY these babies are AWESOME!!! üéß The aesthetic is gorgeous.. sleek, modern, soft, & veryyy comfortable (there's this super comfy memory foam type stuff on the underside part that touches your head). Also, they are insanely USER FRIENDLY, in my opinion. Nothing complicated about them at all. üì¶ When opening the headphones, I cut the tape on each side, slid the interior box out, took the headphones out, grabbed & then opened the instruction manual, easily located the ""pair headphones"" section, & literally with the click of 1 button on the headset and 1 button on my TV, they connected instantly.. & they now connect automatically each time. üíóI absolutely LOVE the setting where you can take the headphones off to talk to someone & it automatically pauses your show (The Guilded Age) and then when you're done talking to that person, you put them back on & it automatically starts your show back up again. ‚èØÔ∏è It seems they've thought of everything!Another thing I'm extremely impressed with is the Noise Cancelling button on the headset. The difference between the ""Transparency"" (hearing outside noises in addition to whatever you're listening to) option and the ""Noise Cancelling"" (only hearing whatever you're listening to) option is PHENOMENAL! My father has the blue Space One's, while I have the beige. The colors of the headphones match the pictures perfectly-üé®! The Noise Cancelling option works so well that if my father has them on, I must tap him or stand in his line of sight (waving like a crazy person) if I want to get his attention! Oh, and the battery life of these puppies is on point!ü©∑ The price isn't ""cheap"", but is WELL WORTH what you get in return. It's relative of course, but to me,100 bucks really isn't that bad- especially with the cost of things nowadays and the quality you get in return!‚ô•Ô∏èSo, in conclusion: When thinking of each aspect of the headphones overall, I can easily & certainly say THESE ARE QUALITY HEADPHONES & if you're on the fence about which headphones to purchase with your hard earned money, these will not let you down!üòÑü•∞",the United States,True,16,R3LSZ3QJZBK20Z,0.1262276785714285,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Surprisingly good travel headphones for the price.",5.0,JLC,2025-01-20,"This is a Boomer review since younger people know much more about headphones than I do, and everyone has them.  But for those who only use headphones on the plane, especially for the noise canceling feature, this is for you.  I specifically looked for plug-in headphones because they are more comfortable than earbuds, and more reliable than bluetooth.  No, these are not Bose headphones, but hilariously, they rank second to Bose on many reviewers' lists!I bought these to replace my 15 year old Audio Technica headphones that still work but are falling apart.  I took both pairs with me on a recent trip and did a comparison.  I could not tell a difference between them, even though the Audio Technica ones covered my ears better.  When not watching movies I wore them just for the noise-cancelling feature, which worked just fine.  I am a relatively small woman so larger people might have a different experience with ear coverage.  These earphones fold up and become quite compact so they don't take up much room in your carry-on bag.  They fit neatly into small, semi-circular cases that are readily available on Amazon, and which  I highly recommend.  The nearly identical version of these headphones at about half the price does not have the noise canceling feature.

So lets be realistic about what you are getting. You are getting a pair of portable headphones that will REDUCE any surrounding noise to the point that whatever you are trying to listen to can be heard. They are not going to silence the surrounding noise, no open element headphone can. These are not the headphones I use when I am flying a plane, but they are the ones I use when I am flying commercially on a A320 and watching movies or listening to music. The battery life is very good, they fold up to reduce the amount of space they take up in your carry on, and they have a nice long cord .

Basically false advertising.",2.0,Amazon Customer,2025-01-04,"My sister got these for me for Christmas, knowing that i was looking for noise cancelling headphones so I wasn‚Äôt destroying my hearing. A big part of noise canceling headphones is that you don‚Äôt need to turn music up loud to hear since all outside noise is tuned out. Sony said on the box that it removes 95% of noise. That‚Äôs not true at all. I have to turn them up just as loud as my $10 wireless earbuds. The sound quality is okay but it removes maybe about 50% of ambient noise. Also, the sound quality is only good when turned up. These get quite dull and somewhat muddy at low volume which again makes them basically useless as advertised. They‚Äôre just cheap over ear headphones. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôd be fine with them if they weren‚Äôt trying to claim 95% noise cancellation. Find something else. You also have to use a battery which is fun, I love listening to music only for the battery to die halfway through. They‚Äôre not rechargeable batteries either, it‚Äôs a physical battery. That‚Äôs just annoying in this day and age. I don‚Äôt want to spend a ton of money on batteries, we know they aren‚Äôt cheap anymore, and it makes so much additional waste.

The only drawback to these headphones is the  two wires coming from each side of the earpieces,  instead of one wire coming from only one side.

Worked great on plane but hurt after 2 hours",4.0,Amazon Customer,2024-04-11,Bought these for a trip and was excited to try them out on the plane.

Even found the perfect case to go with these on Amazon that was so cheap. The only thing I struggled with was that they started to hurt my ears (since they're not over the ear headphones) and the top of my head (no padding) after about 2 hours.  I've tried using them at Starbucks when working and same thing happens.  These are great for short-time use. I used them at the gym for 40-ish minutes and they were great!

Poor charging, poor connectivity",1.0,R. Brent,2025-10-05,"Unfortunately, these have lots of issues. The charging case doesn't properly charge the headphones. They're frequently only charged up to 30%, even if the case has a full charge or is even plugged in. Additionally, putting the headphones in the case is supposed to ""turn them off"" and disconnect them from your phone. Frequently, these will improperly stay connected to my phone even when they are supposed to be off.The audio quality is okay, obviously not up to the standards as the more expensive earbuds.

Multipoint function and app support",5.0,RedMedic1972,2025-10-04,"I just got these today. After pairing and installing the app (Soundcore), I am duly impressed. I have 3 sets of IEM's with bluetooth amp/receivers, from relatively inexpensive to about 100 bucks for a set of IEM's. I have 4 sets of bluetooth ear buds. Again, from relatively inexpensive to about 150 bucks. I am picky, but also am mindful of the intended use of what I purchase. For being active outdoors, I like to get a less expensive product in case it is lost or damaged. However, I look for value for my hard earned money. For other times, I like to invest in a higher end product to enjoy a more engaging experience.That being said - these are almost as good as my more expensive ear buds. That they are multipoint and have app with EQ support is remarkable since they are not expensive. Easy to set up. I use aftermarket tips (Alenza or Spin Fit) so I get a bit more out of them than i do with the included ear tips. Size is comfortable. I am drawn to the 'button' style ear buds vs. the post style due to comfort and compact size, but - this is my second set of 'post/ style are buds - the post style tend to have more battery life. I really like the color selection - I got the green. Connectivity is a breeze - especially with the aforementioned multipoint connectivity. Seamless transition from device to device. All functions are at the tap of a finger, and they are user changeable. Volume range is fantastic. How durable are they? That remains to be seen, however these are well made and the case seems durable. Get the ear tip that suits you and they are comfortable for any ear.I am not paid to write reviews - I just share my experience to help others. I hope this helps you.

You can personalize the controls of the earbuds which gives a lot of flexibility. Overall a great choice.",the United States,True,0,RWUYLP4EBEJYU,0.1907692307692308,2025-10-07T14:14:00

However, I have encountered two issues:1) The range is very bad - I get constant breakup and static beyond my desk, even in my house one floor down (directly below) they're unusable.2) Charging.  Almost every single time I charge them -- and ensure they are clean and properly set and even disconnect the cable and reconnect it -- I will open them when they are ""done"" and one of the earbuds has not charged at all, leaving me with one at 100% and the other typically at 0%, so I have to charge the dead one separately.

They‚Äôre already paired to your device as soon as you take them out of the case, which makes it easy to use. The app has a lot of cool features to fiddle around with, which includes customizable buttons for volume and pausing and mode switching. These buds aren‚Äôt heavy at all either!

Sadly, a miss",3.0,Christine Y.,2025-09-27,"Got these for PC with some Discord comms. Connectivity is so spotty that I can't use these for either purpose.I love Anker products but as a PC user primarily, their audio stuff is mostly a miss. I don't live on my phone, so I can't get the full features without using the dual connect so I can have the Soundcore app up all the time. To get Soundcore app on my PC, I have to install an Android emulator I've never heard of, and I don't use Android and never have.Too much friction with today's tech but it's the best I've been able to find. May keep these as a backup pair for my existing purse audio (also Anker).Otherwise, does fine for fit, though took about ten minutes of attempts to pair with my PC (Win 11, =( ). Audio quality isn't bad even without Soundcore but I'm not an audiophile so YMMV. The buds are too damned small for tap controls so I gave up on that quick.

I tailor mine a little more with an equalizer, but they are nice in that regard. The adjustable head sizing build quality seems weak, as the adjustments can change easy. Nothing like the Sony MDR 7506 headphones I ‚Äòve had for ten years. But the biggest problem for me was the ear pads began to fall apart and I had to replace them. I felt these should have lasted a lot longer than they did. Of course, I use my headphones every day. The noise cancelling is nice and works extremely well.

Great headphones! Just one flaw",4.0,Kelly Brouillard,2025-10-04,"Love the Bose QuietComfort headphones! This is my 2nd pair. Great sound. Truly noise cancelling. Comfortable. Long battery life. Comes with a case. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the wired option is horrible. It comes with a cable so that you can wire the headphones to a device with a headphone jack. I was glad for this option when I was on a long flight and the headphone battery did die. I thought I could just plug into my device with the cable and keep listening. Since I have Apple devices that no longer have a headphone port, I had to have adapters. But when I plug into my iPhone, the sound from the headphones is crackly with a constant clicking sound that I can never get to go away. The volume is also very poor when wired. On my iPad I turned the volume up as high as it can go, and I could barely hear any sound. All in all, I still highly recommend these headphones, as long as you plan to stay with Bluetooth connectivity and not need the wired option.",the United States,True,0,RLPJUJS3AOGI9,0.1381578947368421,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Read before you buy these Spotify branded Bose",1.0,Sarah Gleason,2025-09-30,"For this price I expected more.Product description is not joking... while they continually call it a shortcut button,  deep in the description it says you can start Spotify... literally only Spotify or Battery level.

If you try to make your own profile, and enable ""Wind Block"" it immediately maxes ""Noise Cancelation"" and you lose your awareness in public.Customer service was awful. I got on the chat to ask if the shortcut button had plans to expand to other apps.  He first tried to convince me I just needed to factory reset the headphones. Then he told me I needed to reinstall the app (like that would magical add app features)... then he wrote, ""Also the purpose of the shortcut button is only for the spotify and Hear battery level"".

They've led to so many unprofessional and frustrating moments as I've tried to connect for video meetings etc.The sound and noise cancellation work well, but if I were to do it again I'd get another set of the 35s for almost half the price.

Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones",1.0,Ironmoped,2025-09-23,"I bought Bose Quiet Comfort headphones. They lasted about 8 months and quit working. Bose sent me a replacement set with a new warranty of one year on the replacement. This replacement also quit working, this time an automatic lowering of volume and steady beeping in the headphones. I called Bose again. This time they told me the replacement warranty was only good for 90 days, contrary to what they told me when they sent the replacement. They offered me another replacement set for $239.00 dollars with, after some additional back and forth, an additional 20% discount on top of that. So, for $191.00 dollars, they would send a set of the same headphones (which I've have had problems with twice). I‚Äôm not an audiophile. I use these around the house, gym, etc. For the discounted price of Bose problematic headphones, I can 5 sets of cheaper headphones for their offered discounted replacement price! You get what you pay for? No! Not true. You get what they can convince you to buy with hyped marketing! Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice? Yeah, ain‚Äôt happening. Bose used to be known for quality and support. Not anymore. Your buying products that might be made in the same factory that cheaper alternatives are available from. If you‚Äôre an audiophile, Quiet Comfort headphones are not something you‚Äôre going to buy to fully appreciate what a devoted audiophile would be buying for discerning audio.

It is only a short interruption in what is being listened to, but it is annoying.

Amazing....when they work",2.0,InspectorGadget,2025-09-14,"I find them to be really comfortable, especially since I have not worn over-the-ear headphones in... well, we don't need to discuss that! I bought the QCs to wear for studying and noise cancellation. Unfortunately, they crackle and cut out whenever I need to watch or read something. I spend more time rewinding, trying to figure out what I missed, than studying. Reddit recommended turning off the multipoint on the app, connecting to only one device at a time, being close to the device, and even blowing in the microphones on each headphone. None of that has worked for me. My AirPods work better, sadly. I wouldn't be as annoyed if they weren't so expensive! I got them during Prime Day, and they were still $200. Having them only occasionally work is absolutely not worth the money. I have only had them for 2 months, so it's not an age issue.

Bose VS Sennheiser",5.0,R.C.,2025-09-14,"I recently had to retire my Sennheiser PXC 550 after years of reliable use. Since they no longer make that model and I don't like the new Momentums, I started looking at other brands. So lets compare them:Senn's have a WAY more neutral sound signature and natural sound overall. The Bose in comparison produces insane amounts of bass. It muddies up the mids and highs quite a bit. I lowered the bass by about 7db and it sounds ok now. The reason I ended up getting the Bose is not for sound quality, but for practicality while traveling. They are very light weight, comfortable on the head and the travel case takes up less space in my carry on luggage than any other brand I considered. Noise cancelling is totally adequate. There is better noise cancelling available at this point since this model is not the newest, but I don't think the extra money is worth the marginal improvements you'd get. So, if you are looking for headphones to really dive into your favorite music, don't buy these. If you're looking for the perfect travel headphone to block noise on an airplane, casually listen to some music and watch movies on the plane while fading in and out of consciousness during a 14 hour flight....buy these!",the United States,True,4,R5W4ZGROROKX9,0.1633857808857808,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Just over a year after purchasing this pair (love the green color - it's great!), the microphone has an intermittent failure.  People cannot hear me on WebEx - while intermittent (mostly they can't hear me) it is not acceptable on the call.  Meanwhile, the QC-35's are going along just fine.  I use bluetooth pairing with both headsets with a 2 year old HP work laptop.  Value - for ~1 year of usage, not worthwhile.  For me, this model is a failure for my needs.  If you only need to listen to music/other audio, it's probably fine.  Volume controls are good (esp for WebEx, there's always one person who's very loud) & the headset is very comfortable.

On the subway when I have the Quiet Mode (highest level of noise cancelling), I can hear the wheels of the subway train squealing, other people's conversations, opening and closing door alarms, and all other manner of noise clearly. Total waste of money since I know I can get better noise cancelling capabilities in head phones for a fraction of the price. Volume control is not very good either - it's either too loud or too soft.

Another great product from Skullcandy",4.0,ScottyB,2025-06-26,"I have solely used Skullcandy headphones for well over ten years (JLabs for earpods) and these are pretty sick. I was hearing a white noise when the noise cancellation was turned off but nothing when it was turned on and I was confused until I realized the ""white noise"" was the air conditioner I was standing beside that I could not hear at all when the noise cancellation was turned on. Taking the headphones off while noise cancellation is on can even be disorienting. The ear cups fit my ears perfectly. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are about a half inch too short to fit the way I want, even when fully extended but thats because I have a big head. I absolutely recommend these headphones.Why did you pick this product vs others?:I am a long-time Skullcandy bluetooth headphone user (Uproar, Hesh, Hesh 2) and they have consistently given a great product at a great value even though they seem to have gotten progressively smaller over time LOLNoise cancellation:So good it can be disorienting.

Not good for listening to modern music post 1970 and/or very uncomfortable on larger heads",2.0,radpadre,2025-08-02,"For a Sennheiser pair which is known traditionally for great sound - the sound is not that great- just seems way in the background in terms of soundstage- not up front- and just not crisp- the only exception is if you listen to old jazz CD's- like Billie Holliday, for some reason they sound great, probably cause they were recorded in mono - but modern music not so. And the headphones are not comfortable if you have a big head. After less than an hour of use - I have to take them off.

Too uncomfortable",2.0,Bach,2025-07-22,"I'm not an audiophile by any means but the sound quality didn't blow me away. There was a definite improvement over my previous $30 headphones though. It was noticeably better when watching movies and listening to music. I could hear extra details when watching a film, like glass or debris from an explosion or ambient noises. But I expected a lot more for the price.However the dealbreaker was the comfort. The headphones have too much clamp force and made my ears hurt. I tried stretching the headphones out by setting the earcups between a box but that didn't really help.

The ear cups are soft and breathable, and the fit works well for long sessions without fatigue. Build quality feels solid, and after several months of use, they still look and sound great.

My Fav Open Back Headphones",5.0,Ian C.,2025-07-04,"I switch between two sets of headphones. The HD599 ivory (open) and my Audio Technica (closed).The HD599 have been my main headphones at my desk for the last 3 is years and has never disappointed me. They are so light and comfy on my head. The audio quality is absolutely wonderful. I always sit in Discord calls while playing games and having music on in the background and I haven't found a pair I enjoy more than this. As a audiophreak, I've gone through a lot of different brands and have been disappointed by either parts breaking, cords fraying, or some issue. The only headphones that did better were my pair of Audio Technica M50x that lasted 9 years.The cord length is extremely long, which is great, but can get tangled easily if you don't run a clean setup or have some zip ties.Highly suggest this as a viable option as you probably aren't gonna notice much difference between these and higher costing open back headphones.",the United States,True,1,RJLKB3BVD7VK3,0.2295833333333334,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Perfection",5.0,Adam Akers,2025-07-01,"I primarily use these for gaming or watching videos, listening to music on YouTube. I'm not an audiophile but I really enjoy my ""me time"" on my PC so I want it to be a high quality experience. These deliver on every level.I don't really play many games that need a mic so I just bought an in-line mic add-on from a 3rd party made specifically for these headphones and attached it. It's a cheap boom mic but it picks up fine.The MOST important thing for me is comfort. I have fallen asleep with these on multiple times. It never leaves my ears or scalp sore. I used to have a pair of Astro A40s because of how comfortable they were, but these are superior in just about every way. These are absolutely worth the price if you can afford them. I've had mine for about 5 months. They're the best headphones I've ever used. I bought a nice little SoundBlaster DAC/soundcard to go with them to make sure I got the full range of the headphones and it made a big difference. These are phenomenal. I couldn't be more pleased with them. I plan on using these for as long as they will last, which judging by the high quality materials, I think they'll last many years just like my Astro A40s did.COMFORT: These fit OVER my ears. So many headphones are called ""over-ear"" yet lay on top of my ears. I have detached ear lobes so most headphones lay on my ear lobes slightly and after a few hours will make my ears sore. The clamp strength is also a huge factor. I have a big fat head (because I'm so smart) and most headphones start to feel too snug after awhile. These never do. I've fallen asleep for 6+ hours before at my PC and woke up, forgot I was wearing these, and never felt any discomfort. It's like they were made by a benevolent God just for my cranium. The top of the headphones never press down on the top of my scalp in an uncomfortable way either. The head cushion on my Astro A40s would get uncomfortable after extended sessions but I swear these NEVER do me wrong. These are a gift from heaven and I love them dearly. If you care about audio quality and comfort above all else, you will be pleased with these.",the United States,True,14,R1IV3FLCYU27E1,0.2548818150448585,2025-10-07T14:14:00

I think the 555s sound a little bit more natural and the plastic was nicer feeling back then, but the sound quality is nearly identical. The plastic shell on these feels slightly cheaper than the 555s but they are still quite nice and possibly more durable, they just feel cheaper to the touch. The 3.5mm adapter that they come with is terrible and provides poor sound quality compared to a gold-plated corded one I purchased years ago.

SENNHEISER HD 599",4.0,Boston Photo Man,2025-04-16,"I have been enjoying these headphones for about a week.  I also own a pair of Grado SR80's and Beyerdynamic DT-900's. All open-back headphones for comparison.  I've listening device is a Hiby R4.The Sennheiser's have rather large over the ear cups that are well cushioned.  I find them reasonably comfortable, but occasionally they need to be adjust to remove pressure from my ears.  I have a small head and they sit comfortably without pressure or irritation.To my surprise despite the fact that the Sennheiser's have a slight higher OHM rating compared to my other headphones, they're actually a bit more efficient and produce ample sound from the hiby when set to medium gain.I used the parametric equalizer included with the hiby to make adjustments as I do with all my headphones.  I had to dial in a V-shapred curve to shape the sound to my liking.  Without the adjustments the midrange is just too loud in my opinion and the bass doesn't have sufficient thump.  I also made adjustments on the high frequencies.  With all the adjustments the sounds is quite pleasing.  I listen mostly to Rock & Roll via Amazon hi-fi music streaming.  The sound stage is open, but not quite as airy as my other headphones.  Still, quite satisfactory.  With the midrange adjustments classical music is delightful.I recommend these headphones and think they are a good value.  For folks who aren't willing to play with an equalizer to fine tune the sound, perhaps these might not be the best choice.  Time will tell for durability.  They do have removable cables which is a plus.",the United States,True,4,RONDE26Q9IRTN,0.2508994708994709,2025-10-07T14:14:00

lightweight and comfortable, allows me to stay aware of my surroundings",5.0,seajay,2025-03-12,"great sound on these, though the volume will not feel as substantial as with closed back headphones. it goes a long way for my anxiety because i am able to hear what is around me and not be caught unawares. these are lightweight and very comfortable, fitting around the ear in a way that doesn't bother my piercings (of which i have several going all the way up both ears and an industrial). it's been an hour and so far no fatigue, no sweat in or around my ears, and no soreness from my piercings. i also wear glasses and no issues there either.the original cord is extremely long, and it's a bit tricky to swap to the smaller one. you have to twist then pull, it should come out easily so if it doesn't then twist the other direction and try again. if you like your music loud, then everything will be heard outside your headphones. at mid volume it's less noticable, but if you blast it, these headphones more or less will sound like an old 90s stereo to everyone around you. great for at home, but not public transport, planes, or gym.sound off, i can hear everything just the same as if i weren't wearing headphones. in use, outside sound is muffled and nearly disappears at higher volume, depending on what it is. for example my voice sounds muffled but clearly understanable when i speak while listening to Bach's Cello Suites at volume 60 on my mp3 player. but at the same volume listening to Papercut by Linkin Park, i can just barely hear my voice when speaking at normal volume.MUSIC and MOVIES: music sounds great with these, i've tried classical, EDM, acapella, rock, pop, cinematic, metal. not true basshead level but can be made so with eq or DAC. movie audio is awesome, as long as you slightly modify your bass level on equalizer and turn off all ""enhancement"" settings/plugins on your device. sounds nearly like being right there in a movie theater, it's awesome! Dune, for example, sounds absolutely insane. as do the Marvel movies and the original Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), Nope, and The Thin Man (1934).GAMING: surround sound in games works with these! using Genshin as a lowest-denominator example, in-game i set audio and SFX to maximum and muted vocals and music, surround sound and full dyanmic range with my PC (Win11) volume set to 50. being right in front of a waterfall keeps the sound in both ears no matter the camera direction. but moving away, and slowly moving the camera as the waterfall sound very clearly in different directions. muted when camera is fully away(waterfall behind me), fully in one ear when left or right and quieter in opposite ear, facing the camera full toward the waterfall brings the sound forward in both ears again. the further away, the lesser the sound but the degree of difference remains the same. slowly panning the camera in a circle gradually alters the direction of the audio in sync with where the waterfall is.directly plugged into PC has full, crisp clear audio. when connected to a PS4 DualShock controller (via USB, not wireless), the surround sound effect is less substantial. it's comparable to limited/stereo where all sound is either left/right ear, behind, or in front with not much in between.",the United States,True,5,R1OJ61IX967AVD,0.1485841269841269,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Brilliant, Warm Sound",5.0,Brandon Taylor,2025-02-21,"After endless research, and testing out the HD 560S and Tygr 300R, the HD 599's are the resounding winner. The 560S's sounded fantastic, but were uncomfortable. The Tygr 300R's were very comfortable, but the sound quality wasn't nearly on par with the 560S's in my opinion. Enter the HD 599's. These sound fantastic, albeit they have warmer sound than the 560S's (which isn't bad but might not be preferred for some), and are MUCH more comfortable than the Hd 560S's. The qualities of the 599's combine everything I needed out of open back earphones.

Work just like my 598's",5.0,Evan,2024-12-21,"I've owned the Sennheiser 598SE's for a long time - I bought them black Friday in 2016. They STILL work. For a gamer, my headsets had a lifespan of about 2-3 years before something went wrong. Be it a broken mic, broken earmuff, sound going in and out, or I broke the band, I continuously forked over money for something new. This product is superior to all of those in every way.The problem with most headphones that I have found is the cord. Now that wireless is more common it's less of an issue - but chairs running it over, picking the headphones up by yanking the cord, etc., all add up to a guaranteed replacement every couple years. The cord being detachable is the best innovation in my opinion. My original 598SE's have been through 3 cords.

Phenomenal audio at the cost of feeling cheaply made.",4.0,Kevin,2024-12-20,"Now I'm no professional or have experience with $1000 audio setups. I have tinnitus for goodness sake but I do enjoy music everyday like the kid from baby driver.I came from the HyperX Cloud original editions. Say what you will about them now but the first generation was a fine headset that I used for about 9 years. Now I could've used them for 9 more but curiosity got the best of me and I wanted to know how much better my audio could get, after much researching I found these. Low price, on sale, about $110. Good enough for a college student before I get to the big boys with amps.Immediately after trying them on they felt subpar in build material compared to the Clouds. The hinges have a slight squeak and the pleather for the headrest was thin and doesn't have much give to it. I have discomfort set in after 3 hours at my PC. I do like the material used for the cups. It is soft and breathable. It's nice they have replaceable 3.5mm jacks. I have no problem babying my equipment but life will happen eventually.The audio at first threw me off. Only listening to one pair of headphones for 9 years I hated the sound at first. I almost returned them immediately. Music sounded like it was thrown threw a hastily made EQ. After much comparison I started to attenuate to the sennheisers. Suddenly I could hear things that I've never heard in my favorite songs, new instruments in the background and staging separation. It was like listening to them for the first time, what a wonder!These headphones have ruined my old beloved Clouds, I cannot listen to them again without hearing the lack of treble the Clouds have. While the sennheisers are open back and the clouds are closed, it was a close comparison to bass levels. It's no thumping or head shaking but it is restrained and controlled to get the rhythm going.One day I may lubricate the hinges or add a foam block to the top of the rest but for $110 I couldn't find a better option than going up exponentially in price.",the United States,True,8,R13Y2G2CBUXYPT,0.1908476658476658,2025-10-07T14:14:00

Coming From The Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros There's A Lot To Take In",3.0,Lemon Lime Cola,2024-12-12,"To preface I am an audiophile, at least by definition. I don't do super duper hi-fi to the point where i'm spending thousands and thousands on headphones. The most expensive pair I own and use are the: Meze Audio 109 Pro's, which sound god tier to an almost untouchable level on anything real and analog, but perfectly amazing on everything else. You can mix, master, track, and enjoy these but I baby them so I really only use them for music enjoyment. I also own a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro's the MKII s, which are my second favorite pair, that I use a bit more in the studio for double and triple checking mixes. That are certainly becoming my favorite pair and will likely be my workhorse in the studio, once I get over the $700 price tag for fear of breaking and heres why...I had to replace my DDT770 pros for the third time in like two years. I absolutely adore them but their build quality is very fragile and not made for anything other than soft ""respectful"" use. Anyone with these who is unruly, a bit careless, or not paying attention, will have their lifespan cut in half if not by more. As well to make matters worse the versions I had didn't include a breakaway cable so anytime it got tugged or twisted it just did more and more damage till eventually being completely unusable. The pair I had originally lasted a year, the second lasted about eight months before it did the same, and its all in the cable just from everyday use of 15+ hours. I originally started years and years ago on the HD280 Pros by Sennheiser for tracking and recording and they were awesome, so I went back to Sennheiser when I saw these were on sale for$85. I saw someone say these were certainly an upgrade over the DT-770 Pros, and another user on Reddit said they're more of a side grade. I disagree with both. Here's why:The Bleed:The big difference between the two is that these are open back and the DT770 pros are closed. That being said, the bleed on these is insane. In a discord call, everyone can hear what I'm listening to even when I'm not speaking. When recording voice overs the thing I'm listening to also comes through. It's pretty wild how bad it is. This is my biggest gripe with these as other open back headphones I've had sure had bleed but these are really really bleeding through to the audio source being recorded with no way to hide it. My SM7B about two to four inches away from my mouth, it's incredibly clear as if I was sharing the song to you, and at 6-7 inches away it's still very audible just with a bit more distance, and it's crazy to say that even 5 feet back it's still audible but as background noise. It started to lose the audio pickup of the headphones entirely around 9 feet away. That's crazy to me, considering how with my DT-770 Pros I could be basically inside the mic and no bleed was coming through at all.Just for this reason I may return them as I do a lot of recording.For Mixing:To mix music, these are a lot more different in terms of frequency response than the DT-770 Pros. They're so much bassier it's crazy. While I grew up as a ""bass-head"" and loved bass the boost is around 150hz and then again in 7.5k. So that's bass, thump, and clang, as well as vocals and air. Drums are VERY dynamic, mixing drums on these is ""fun"" but guitars, and other mostly mid focused instruments have a bit more hype in the lows and highs than I'd like. Things do sound fuller and more clear on these over the DT-770 Pros but its a different kind of clear and full than I'd like. I think mixing on theses and using them as mixing headphones after about five different mixes (genres of music) and ten hours of mixing through a few days with breaks in between is slightly better, it's just a different approach to how I did it prior so this is going to mess you up if you were mixing on DT-770 Pros and are coming over from them to these. While learning any new pair of headphones is a thing for sure, the learning curve from the DT-770s to these are a bit trickier. I think these sound a bit closer to mixing with the Sony MDR-7506 so if you're used to them, these will probably feel very similar. It's just the MDR-7506's are much flatter.The biggest shock from mixing on these to the DT-770s or the MDR-7506's was how it felt going back and forth between my main monitors, all three pairs of headphones, and then my monitors again - to find the differences and how they translate. I was hearing things in the 599s that I wasn't in the MDR-7506's and then when going back into my favorite pair of headphones the DT-770 I knew what to look for, and what was missing from the mix. I fixed them in the DT-770s waited about twenty minutes and rechecked on the 599s and its like that frequency is entirely missing and doesn't sound good cause now my mix sounded terrible. I go back to my monitors and its also a bit more balanced but still feels off. I was second guessing all my mix work and truthfully I was quite frustrated. I decided to do a few mixes with both and then mix them up in a set of blind tests a few days later on A or B, I was picking the mix I did with the 599s most times than not - in the car, on my home theater system, in non treated environments. Then on my monitors hearing them, in my studio, treated, and on my Airpods, I was going to the DT-770 Pros every time just about. This test made me question much more outside of the headphones. It added to my frustration. Ear Fatigue is a real thing and option paralysis is too, even with blind tests, the back and forth I'm not sure which of the pairs I like better for mixing, I think they're both good, i think they both deliver quality results, I just think its how you mix on them, what you're mixing, the room you're in that'll change what choices you make. I do mostly Metalcore, Pop-Punk, Post-Hardcore, Pop, and Hip Hop/Rap. These sound good for low end stuff cause there is that slight boost, rap and hip-hop, trap, edm, all were much easier to mix with these.Enjoying Music:As I mentioned above these are bass boosted in the 150hz area, low end snare, kick, bass guitar, pulsating bass, synth bass, or low vocals such as mongolian throat singing is wild. It's so thick and full, in fact if you hear any side chained bass that ducking out any low frequencies in these headphones, the mix is night and day. It's like toast with butter, then dry stale bread that sounds like flaking crusty trash.  On the low end stuff that sounds so fat and huge. You notice it instantly. When listening to people talk, everyone has thicker, deeper, much low ranged voices due to that boost. If you're a bass-head and love thick low bass you'll quite enjoy these. It also has that boost in the highs over at 7.5/8k and so vocals sound nice and sizzle on snare or any sort of pop from a plucked synth or guitar solo cuts on these also. The rest of the curve is flat so music comes through as it's mostly intended, thus making them really solid for listening and mixing. I do think I prefer listening to music on these over the DT-770 Pros, but i'll say this, it took about two weeks to feel that way.Thoughts:Where I feel these would excel, at the gym, where you need to hear your environment but still want a great sound while working out. I love Airpods, I think they're one of the best sounding headphones you can get for like $100 that are in ear and small. These do the doggy poop all over Airpods and make them literal trash in comparison. They're a no brainer. It's just these are huge and massive. If you don't care about massive headphones these would be the choice with no question.I also think using a headphone amp on these or a preamp makes the experience all the more better. I would highly recommend that if possible. Listening to analog music this way through a preamplifier is amazing. I spin records on my table and listened with these through my preamp and it was awesome. Really solid, made everything feel so alive and real, if you don't feel like kicking on the big speakers and want to sit in a room and just vibe.The pros here are the length of the cable that it comes stock with for headphone 3.5mm to the 1/4inch input. It's huge, I hated that about the DT-770 Pros. It's not as long but it's also nice for them to include a 3.5 to 3.5mm cable for phones and laptops and stuff, as well as a 1/4 inch to 3.5mm converter.The build quality is nice as is most things from Sennheiser. My original pair of HD280s I still have as a tracking pair in one of my rooms, they're beat to heck, scratched, and not a single part is broken, I change out the pads like every year or so. I would expect these to do the same. The fact they have the break away cable is nice, all companies need to do this as breaking a cable is the easiest thing to do and it should be the quickest thing to fix, not having to take a part the pair and re-solder, etc. I will also say these came in ""frustation free"" packaging. Which was just a little brown box, no fancy opening experience like say an Apple product or something premium, if you didn't know what you had you'd think these were cheap as dirt.While I said the sound boosts at 120hz so low frequencies, and again at the 7.5k so high frequencies. The musical spectrum is great. Almost everything I put through these was solid. As a great first pair of ""serious"" phones, these are absolutely worth it. I wouldn't go to anything less. If you're coming from the DT-770s or anything by Beyerdynamic this is like Soup vs Salad. It's gonna take some time. I'm still not sure I want to keep them. As I'm still within the return period, I may get rid of them. I may keep them for the gym, idk. I paid $85 but at $200, I don't feel they're worth that point at all i'd suggest the Beyerdynamics all day everyday. Headphones or love or hate and brand loyalty is weird, so as someone who has a studio and is giving a mix of both sides, hopefully this can help you. If I never heard the Beyers and my other open backs didn't bleed this bad, i'd say these could sit with the big dogs, but for those reasons I gave them a 3 star. Though it's more like 3.5/5. Especially at the $85. If it's the normal $200 or even $150 they're mostly marked at, it's a 3/5.Mixing 4/5Mastering: 3/5Tracking/Recording/VA Work: 2/5Listening: 4/5Build Quality: 4/5Feel: 4/5Price: 3/5Packaging: 2/5",the United States,True,6,R3DTL5SPSOUFAN,0.1160510029876226,2025-10-07T14:14:00

I'm not completely sure if this set had a flaw or if it's by design but it's like I can hear the speaker flapping in the shell with any sort of bass.They don't feel great around the ears and if I set the ""strap"" loose enough to not feel uncomfortable on top of my head then the earpieces sag so they're basically hanging from my ears, rather than having enough tension to hold on to the sides of my head.I don't know if the smaller than 3.5mm plug on the headphone end of the cord is a common thing, but i've never ran into it before and seems like one of those things to make you buy replacements exclusively from them. Not a fan of that kind of thing.the one positive I have to say is that this being my first pair of open-backs I can tell that in the long term that would help lessen ear fatigue. but I assume that could be said for any open back headphones so probably nothing special..My $30 Oneodio headphones sound better and are more comfortable despite being on-ear.

Comfort with Quality",5.0,Josh Duch,2024-11-23,"I've had these headphones for 5 years. For me, Sennheiser is a trusted brand. I've only owned two Sennheiser phones in my life, and my first pair lasted me for 9 years. Technically they still work, but the plastic jacket for the wires are exposed. They still sound great; I was just not comfortable being around exposed cable.One of my favorite aspects of these headphones are the fact that they completely cover my ear. Earbuds tend to slip out of my ear more often than I'd like. Whenever I put these cans on, they stick, and I never have to adjust them.Not only are these phones extremely comfortable, you get the full range of sound. You do not need to turn up the volume too high. They are open back headphones, so if you are recording vocals, for example, there will be bleed over to the microphone, depending on how hot the mic is. However, I do not record very often - if at all - so it is no issue for me. Open back headphones allow you to hear the room around you, so if that is not desirable, consider closed back headphones. Please be mindful that I am just a random Amazon customer, not an audio engineer.The phones come with a 1/4"" adapter, which allows one to plug into either an interface or even an amp for practice. I use it for the latter; a bass amp, to be specific. The bass sounds great through the phones, though sometimes I hear the headphones rattle because I tend to turn up the volume. This is because I wear earbuds underneath the Sennheisers - which are noise canceling - and that causes me to turn up the volume on my amp, thus causing the rattling. I wear earbuds because I usually practice at night and want to be able to hear the metronome/drum backtrack so as to not disturb my housemates. So it is a delicate balance to make sure I do not blow out the speakers on my phones. Something to keep in mind; I do not know if these headphones were necessarily made to blast the sounds of a bass amp. My amp is a Hartke HD75, and I typically practice with Low's/Mid's/High's at 12 o'clock and the EQ flat. I hear the rattling when turning up to approx. 3.5 on the volume knob.All that being said, I still give these headphones 5 stars because they are fantastic.

I'm not sure if deceptive marketing or a mistake.  The headphones are nice other than that, just make sure when connecting and disconnecting the wires that the headphone needs them locked in place.

Same when you plug in the shorter 3.5 connecter, if you just plug it in and don't turn it to the left till it locks in place, it will only play audio from one ear.",the United States,True,1,ROKG4OGAK6MQS,0.1510714285714285,2025-10-07T14:14:00

The sound limiting is legit and works. My son has been using these for the past year and now uses them at school( with the included cord) on his classroom Chromebooks. The headphones have always fit his tiny head just fine but he does complain of ""hot ear"" and discomfort from the constant pressure of the headphones cups pressing on his ears. Usually thats after wearing them for an hour or more but honestly the cups could be slightly larger, or replaceable, and could fit around the ear better. My son prefers using them in wired mode simply because it's less hassle when connecting between devices and there's less chance of technical or connectivity issues. Overall these have proven to be dependable, high quality headphones that have seen a ton of use over the past year and will hopefully see us through this school year.

My fix is to superglue the ear cushions in place.  I've had to replace some ear cushions with aftermarket alternatives, where they have fallen off and gotten lost or discarded.

Could use a bit more volume",4.0,Winchester2,2024-04-16,"These headphones work well enough to watch shows, movies and internet videos.  Dialogue is clear if there are only one or two people talking.

Once again, if the music is simple such as a single acoustic guitar playing, they aren‚Äôt bad, but the average pop or rock song sounds muddy and flat. Bass is basically non-existent.The headphones themselves are comfortable on the head. I don‚Äôt find them to be tight and I have a large head. The ear pieces are well padded and work well to block out surrounding noise.  The cord is very long, but you can keep the extra looped and tied like it arrives. I appreciate that the cord is straight and not one of those curly cords which can be annoying. There‚Äôs a volume control right on the cord, but the range seems extremely limited. I find with my computer at half volume, I hear just fine through the speakers. It‚Äôs actually a bit loud. I plug in the headphones and half volume doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough and I have to max the volume control on the headphones to equal what I heard through the speakers.

Good for dialog and vocals",4.0,MGB,2024-04-02,"No idea if this the result of deliberate design decisions, or just a product of mid- to low-end components, but these headphones have a very specific audio presentation that emphasizes vocals, dialogue, and higher end frequencies. This makes them good for picking out dialog in TV watching, which, to be fair, seems to be the main thrust of the marketing. Especially for older folks whose hearing may not be what it used to be (and let's be honest, sound mixing in a lot of modern media is a mess). On the flipside, midrange is lacking, and bass is downright anemic. Take the marketing at face value -- there's probably a good reason that music is not referenced anywhere.

Ive had these for a solid 2 months now and I can confidently say these headphones are a game changer. The battery lasts hours on end. The noise cancellation is pretty up there for the price. I love transparency mode. I tend to either be noise sensitive sometimes so being able to muffle things but still hear what‚Äôs going on around me is top notch! The app is slightly finicky with it sometimes not registering that the headphones are connected but that‚Äôs not a big issue since I don‚Äôt use it much. The design is nice!

They work great but they fit kind of weird on the head.",4.0,Robert,2025-10-04,"Rather than sitting right on the head, these have too much curvature to them which makes them look kind of strange.  It's unfortunate because other than that they are decent headphones.They seem very durable and are other wise comfortable.  The sound quality and noise cancellation are decent but obviously don't match up with higher end ones, but since these cost a lot less, it's an obvious trade-off.The Amazon branding isn't too prominent and the controls are pretty easy to use.  We are used to headphones that you tap on to pause, answer a call, activate/deactivate noise cancellation and these require you to hunt for the button with your finger.  If you aren't used to the ones with the tap method, getting used to these is probably pretty easy, for us it wasn't.They would make a great pair as a spare or ones to use on your commute on a train/bus, or even at the gym.  Since they aren't Beats/Apple/Sony/Sennheiser/etc. you are much less likely to have them swiped.  They'd also be great for a child.Overall we feel they are a decent value for the money, though there are pairs on Amazon that offer more functionality for a similar price.  Those usually aren't name brands and since we are assuming that Amazon is doing a lot of work to vet these, you'd likely be better with these vs. some company that nobody has ever heard of.Other than the overly curved headband part, we are happy with them.  The battery life is as advertised and for that reason as well as the reasons above we give them a 4/5 star rating and our recommendation.",the United States,False,2,R1EBJ5MLU895SS,0.2182072829131652,2025-10-09T18:19:29

Very good noise cancellation and listening experience at a relatively low price.",5.0,Samantha,2025-10-01,"I got these a few weeks ago and wanted to wait until I had used them for a while to give a review.Overall, these are really good headphones with nice noise cancellation. At the time I received my pair via Vine, the retail price was $35. I think these headphones are more like a steal at that price.My first thought when I put on the Amazon pair was that they were *really* comfortable. The ear cups fit mostly around my ear, but I don't get any pain or fatigue from wearing them. They also stay in place, even when I sweat from housework. They have paired easily with all my devices - phone, home pc, work laptop. I have only listened to audio and have not used any phone capabilities, so I can't comment on that. They are also relatively light compared to my other full-sized headset and I really like that. Even though my other set is an older pair of high-quality Bose headphones, the good qualities of this Amazon headset have had me reaching for it instead.Noise Cancellation: This is my first pair of headphones with noise cancelling. I was shocked at how much it dampened noise around me. It definitely improved my listening experience through some noisy neighbors. The sound quality is good. I can clearly hear the things I want to hear. I'm not an audiophile so I can't describe the audio in those kinds of terms.Battery Life: I have not worn/used the headphones for the stated amount of hours, but I can say that I have been able to go several days without charging them. I typically wear headphones all day on the weekends, and I have definitely been able to listen at 8 hour stretches with no problem. I have no issue believing that the battery life is as described.Buttons/Interface: The interface is pretty limited, which makes sense with the lower price point. It has a round, flat power on/off button. The noise cancellation button is also round but has a raised sound wave on it to help differentiate it by feel. I can typically tell the difference, but due to some health problems, I have been experiencing some neuropathy (tingling, numbness) in my fingers and that makes it hard to make sure i am pressing the right button. I may put a drop of glue or something else next to the power button to help guide me by touch on those days.Small Nitpicks:The voice announcing power on/power off is very loud. It is static and cannot, as far as I know, be changed or turned off. If I have been listening at lower volumes, sometimes it blasts my ears a little.My main ""problem"" is that there is no way to tell how much battery life is left. There is no screen on the headset, and my Samsung phone doesn't pick up the remaining battery percentage when I connect to it. My computer will. Along with the lower price point, there is no app to use with these which might tell the remaining battery. An app would make the product more expensive, so again, I understand why there isn't one. I will just have to listen for the announcement, I guess.Overall, these are a solid 4.5 stars. If they are in your price range, get them. They're great as a primary or even backup pair of headphones.",the United States,False,0,R1TTF63UA566R2,0.1810971055088702,2025-10-09T18:19:29

Long battery life. Comfortable",4.0,Sarah,2025-09-28,"I love these over-the-head headphones for my audiobooks and to listen to the TV while I'm at home constantly in and out of the room with the TV. That way I can still put lsundry away, do the dishes, clean the bathrooms ectThey connect effortlessly to multiple devices.  They ate comfortable. They are a great value.  I'll still prefer my earbuds when working out. We will also be taking them on vacation and will be great with the noise canceling for the car ride then the airplane.  All the buttons are on the right ear.  The power button is flat and circular. The ANC button is  also circular, but sticks up more.

Punches Way Above Price",5.0,NWGirl,2025-09-26,"I have tried a $600 product, and also a product at a comparable price. With the $600 product I got ""ear suck"" where my ears felt pressure when the noice canceling ANC feature was on. After doing some reading about this, I assumed I wouldn't be able to tolerate any noice canceling. I bought these simply to listen to music with the ANC turned off. To my delight and great surprise, I do not get ear suck with these!!! In addition, they are very comfortable, fold into many positions which make them work for just about any headphone case out there, I can wear them for hours without getting a headache (not true for other headphones like ear muffs for mowing the lawn). The sound quality (both treble and base and mids) is impressive for the price point. I'm very happy listening to music (classical, Hamilton, Celtic, opera (Pavarotti, Montsserrat Caballe...) as well as audiobooks and text to voice. I am musically trained and have also run an Alan and Heath GL 4200 sound system and I am pretty happy with the sound quality.

This is something earbuds can‚Äôt always handle.Comfort & Style ‚Äì Cushioned ear cups make them comfortable, though they can get warm over time. The matte black looks good if you don‚Äôt mind the bulk.Drawbacks & Suggestions:All the controls - volume, power, ANC toggle, and multi-function buttons, are crammed onto the right ear cup. While wearing them, it‚Äôs hard to tell which is which, so I often have to take the headphones off to adjust settings. Separating the buttons or adding distinct textures would fix this.If you can live with the awkward controls, these are a solid, affordable choice for long-lasting noise-canceling headphones with the bonus of wired playback when you need it.",the United States,False,3,R2M6O4RA8ZOYJ0,0.2288584603801995,2025-10-09T18:19:29

I've notice higher frequency noises do seem to slip through though. The transparency feature does works okay if you want to hear things around you. I've never really had a pair of headphones though where the transparency feature works very good. Also ear cushions are pretty comfortable. I do wish though they were a bit on the bigger side though. My ear basically fills up the entire opening and the cushions push against them a little bit. Range is really good too.

Headphones that mask low end droning noise",4.0,Amazon Vine-o,2025-09-14,"I‚Äôve owned a wide range of headphones from $20 beaters to $500 sets, but this is my first pair with active noise cancelling. Overall, I‚Äôd call these decent for the price with a few quirks worth pointing out.Pairing was simple, hold the power button, select them on your device, and you‚Äôre ready to go. Button functions are straightforward, and I was surprised to find you can even take calls through the headphones. I haven‚Äôt tested call quality yet, but it‚Äôs a nice option to have.There are three modes: NC on, NC off, and Transparent. In normal conversation level background noise, the NC effect was subtle. The real difference came when I tested them against a loud fan. The low frequency hum dropped noticeably, which seems to be the kind of sound these headphones are designed to reduce. Transparent mode works best with music paused, letting you hear voices and room sounds through the built in mics.The sound quality differs across modes.NC ON: Boosts the low end heavily. It helps mask noise but makes music sound a bit muddy. Fun for casual listening, not for accuracy.Transparent: Cuts lows sharply to prioritize outside sound, but with music playing you still won‚Äôt hear much of your surroundings.NC Off: Surprisingly the weakest mode. Flatter, thinner sound compared to NC On. Useful only if you‚Äôre stretching battery life.Overall, these headphones do a fair job cutting droning, low frequency noise but won‚Äôt give you silence. The sound signature changes a lot between modes, and I found NC On the most listenable even with its boomy bass. If you want perfectly balanced audio, you may prefer a non NC set at this price.

I had to turn the music volume up to almost max, and I could still hear everything on the plane. I used the app, which was pointless, and all functions were to no avail.

I actually enjoy wearing them. I charged them once and it's been weeks since I've charged it again. I don't use them a lot but when I use them they are still charged so that's all that matters to me. It was easy to connect to my phone, it talks to you to let you know its on and connected. The buttons are on the right headphone to cut it on and change the volume. So straightforward for a lady like myself that don't like fussing with stuff. It doesn't completely cut the sound out but it takes the bite out of the noise so that you don't care anymore and are able to focus on what you are listening to. Which explains a lot about when young people have stuff like this on their heads.

Great BT headphones",5.0,Adam,2025-10-08,"Like a lot of people, I tend to only write reviews when I am particular impressed or disappointed in a product and I must say, I am impressed.Before buying these, I purchased and returned a set of airpod pro 2s and a $50 set of JBLs. Those headphones worked well but they just weren't comfortable and did not fit my ears, despite even trying them with the foam cover deals.These fit and work just as well as the airpods and quite a bit better than the JBLs that were nearly double the price.They connect easily to a variety of devices - my PC, my iphone, my apple tv. I can even have the iphone and my PC connected at the same time and switch seamlessly between the two of them.They have a transparent mode and a noise cancellation mode and a mode that is kinda in between the 2. The noise cancellation definitely makes a big difference. My lawnmower is extremely loud, and these make a big difference but I still wear a set of muffs over them just so I can keep the volume low as I have very sensitive ears. In my experience these seemed to work as well or nearly as well as the airpod pro 2.I haven't really pushed the battery life to the limit yet but I have used them for as much as 4 hours a day or so and just charge them each night and they have not yet went dead.They can be programmed through the app on your phone to control the volume, pause or switch tracks with a certain number of clicks on either the left or right bud. The case charges and is a nice size, pretty handy.Stop searching, these are the ones.",the United States,True,0,R2ZBD5YA5SWBTC,0.1588461538461539,2025-10-10T10:20:01

I‚Äôm easily spooked so I love the option to be able to hear people talking to me. Sometimes I just pop them in as earplugs with nothing playing(my bf is a noise 24/7 kinda fella) so it‚Äôs nice to drown that out but not have everything totally muffled and spooky!

I contacted Bose and they refuse to do any repairs on the headphones, and worse, the replacement cost they offered was more expensive than their website price.

Good Hardware, Flawed Firmware",3.0,Eddie Mascari,2025-10-09,"These are great headphones, with some pretty significant drawbacks.For the good, they sound great and have absurdly long battery life, I've gone days without charging them and they haven't died once.As for the bad, the ANC. It turns on by default whenever you turn on the headphones, makes the audio quality slightly worse, and if you're not used to ANC it feels painful (which is not unique to these, just a problem with ANC in general). They are also prone to static clicks and screeches while listening to things, which can be at best jarring and at worst ear-piercing.There is an app for managing settings, sound profiles, and switching between ANC, standard, and passthrough without using one button to cycle through them, which isn't great that it needs that for full functionality but that's the case with a lot of bluetooth headphones.",the United States,True,0,R3B93MCP37IVGI,0.1782894736842105,2025-10-11T06:20:21

Only buy on sale, good for the price",2.0,Trevor Bodi,2025-10-09,"The initial build qualities is really good. The sound is good for the price, the range is good for the price, I found that the band did not clamp my head enough. So when using them at the gym, they would fall off my head doing anything on the bench.At the 18 month mark is when I started having issues. The plastic frame on the right ear cracked at the headband and I had to fix it with superglue. Now, three months later after that, the earpiece started coming apart and there‚Äôs no way to fix that. Now it is just a blown out earpiece and the headphones are unusable.On sale these headphones are great, but if you‚Äôre looking for something, that‚Äôll last, you a long time just save up the money and get a better brand or a better model. If someone is in a pinch, I would recommend these, but just know that after a year or two you will most likely have to replace them.I used these almost every day for a business and for the gym and for mowing the lawn.The app was really easy to use and the sound quality and noise.

Incredible quality and worth every penny",5.0,Joe Cook,2025-10-10,"So, full disclosure, I did not purchase these headphones on amazon, but I did receive them as a gift but I am so blown away that I had to come leave a comment so that everyone else will know just how great these headphones are! They are so comfortable comma they are lightweight and the ear cups fit perfect i literally wear these for hours a day whether it's working or coming home and gaming. The sound quality is incredible, it feels like you are literally wrapped in the song or audio book. The noise canceling on them is insane.I often times don't even realize how loud Im talking. I'm currently using them as my office is going under renovations and I can't hear the majority of the construction going on, just one office over. They have pretty great range.I oftentimes walk away from my game room to go to the kitchen and I don't lose connection at all, the battery life is great I charge them maybe once every couple of days maybe once a week? But what really blew me away and made me come comment was the fact that I just realized i've had these for years literal YEARS with out any kind of drop in quality. i've dropped them and use them almost daily for several years, and they are still going strong. The only thing is that the ear cuffs wore down, so I ended up replacing them with some third party replacements which were super easy to install even if they aren't as comfy as the original material.

My husband has ear bud style noise canceling headphones that are WONDERFUL from Walmart and I love them but all in ear styles hurt my ears. So I got these hoping for the same or better quality nc experience. The only thing these cancel out are low hums like that of a washing machine in the background. If you are looking to wear these to the gym to block out overhead music, read a book while your kids are in the same room, or anything other normal activity and hoping to block out every day noises these are not it.",the United States,True,0,R3V17Z9T1RFNHJ,0.2825,2025-10-13T13:20:33

Work well, until‚Ä¶",2.0,Amazon Customer,2025-10-11,"The sound quality and noise cancellation are good enough for a casual user although the fit of the headphones always seemed a bit loose.
